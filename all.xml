 Background to the current application 
 
1 The applicants Sharman Networks Ltd ('Sharman Networks'), Sharman License Holdings Ltd ('Sharman License') and Ms Nicola Anne Hemming ('Ms Hemming') are each the subject of asset preservation orders made by Wilcox J on 22 March 2005 ('the Mareva orders').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">When referring to the applicants generally, I will do so as 'the Sharman applicants'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Each of the Sharman applicants was one of ten respondents to infringement of copyright proceedings brought by the present respondents ('the Music companies') in respect of the operation of what was described by the parties as the 'Kazaa system' ('the primary proceedings').</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Wilcox J made orders ancillary to the Mareva orders on 22 March 2005 requiring each of the Sharman applicants to disclose on affidavit the description and value of all of their assets, wherever situated, and to specify whether those assets were held by each applicant either beneficially or in trust for any other person or entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 Wilcox J delivered judgment on the complex issues of liability arising in the primary proceedings on 5 September 2005 ( Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In the meantime, Ms Hemming had filed two disclosure affidavits pursuant to Wilcox J's orders of 22 March 2005 whilst Sharman License and Sharman Networks had unsuccessfully sought several stays on various grounds of that same order insofar as it applied to them (see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 406 per Hely J, delivered 8 April 2005; Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 441 per Wilcox J, delivered 15 April 2005 and Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 505 per Moore J, delivered 28 April 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Disclosure affidavits were eventually sworn on behalf of Sharman License and Sharman Networks by Mr Gee on 19 April 2005, which were later superseded by further affidavits sworn also by Mr Gee on 16 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Sharman License and Sharman Networks had also unsuccessfully sought an enlargement of time in which to file an application for leave to appeal from Wilcox J's orders of 22 March 2005 (see Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 per Lindgren J, delivered on 17 June 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 On 24 May 2005, the Music companies filed a further amended notice of motion seeking further orders ancillary to the Mareva orders, which application was heard over several days by Moore J and determined by his Honour on 17 November 2005 substantially in favour of the Music companies ( Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1587).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The Sharman applicants acknowledge that the orders made by Moore J pursuant to that determination were interlocutory in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">What had led to the Music companies' application for those ancillary orders were deficiencies in the asset disclosure affidavits provided by the Sharman applicants pursuant to the ancillary orders of Wilcox J made on 22 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It is from Moore J's interlocutory judgment of 17 November 2005 that the Sharman applicants presently seek leave to appeal, pursuant to O 52 r 10(2) of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 The principal orders made by Moore J on 17 November 2005 were as follows:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The applicants have leave to cross examine [Ms Hemming] on the affidavits filed and served by her in response to Order 5 of the orders of Wilcox J made on 22 March 2005, on such matters as the Court may later direct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">[Ms Hemming] file and serve, within such time and [sic] the Court may specify, an affidavit that discloses with particularity the description and value of all the assets of [Sharman Networks] (and its subsidiaries within the meaning of section 9 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that are wholly owned) wherever situated and specifying whether those assets are held by [Sharman Networks] (or such wholly owned subsidiaries) beneficially or in trust for any other person or entity and further specifying: 
 
 
 
 a. in the case of any bank accounts which [Sharman Networks] (or such wholly owned subsidiaries) controls, the name of the bank in which the account is held, the name of the branch, the name of the account, the name of a person in whose name the account is held, the account number, and the balance of the account as at the date of service of the orders; 
 
 b. the name and address of any person or entity who holds any assets on trust or as nominee for [Sharman Networks] (or such wholly owned subsidiary); 
 
 c. details of any trust or arrangement pursuant to which such assets are held; 
 
 d. details of any charge, mortgage or other security grouped in relation to any asset; and 
 
 e. details of any contracts entered into for the sale, mortgage, charge or other disposition of the assets or any part thereof or interest therein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Order 1 made by Wilcox J on 22 March 2005 is varied by inserting before the words "other than" the following words: 
 
 (and, as to [Sharman Networks], be restrained from causing or permitting any wholly owned subsidiary to dispose of, to remove from Australia or to deal with in any way any of that subsidiary's money, property or other assets in or outside Australia)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">' 
 
 

5 The immediate background to much of the debate presently raised by the Sharman applicants, and as a consequence the principal focus of their attack upon the orders of Moore J below, concerned the existence of alleged shortcomings in the asset disclosures, and in particular the implications of a payment of $1,116,405.63 made by Ms Hemming to a Vanuatu company, Trustees International Limited ('TIL'), following upon the sale of the Sydney residence of Ms Hemming and Dr Kilmer-Barber for $2,100,000 on 4 February 2005, being a payment made purportedly by way of repayment of a loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Music companies' case presented to Moore J below was that there was in fact no such antecedent loan, that the transfer of such funds by Ms Henning to TIL in Vanuatu constituted a sham loan repayment, and that such funds have therefore continued to be her own moneys on the footing presumably of a constructive trust, and should have been identified as such in her affidavit of disclosure of her assets made pursuant to the Mareva orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Although Moore J declined to make a finding in relation to the issue as to ownership of that fund, his Honour formed the view that he would permit cross-examination of Ms Hemming on matters concerning the fund, by reason of doubts attending the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">His Honour reasoned in that regard at [37] of his reasons for judgment as follows:
 
 'In all, real doubts arise about, and uncertainty surrounds, the reason why this transaction took place when it did and whether the monies transferred to TIL were, in truth, in satisfaction of a loan or continues to constitute an asset of, and requires disclosure by [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Greater clarity about this matter may arise from the cross-examination of [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">' 
 
 Legal principles informing the grant of leave to appeal 
 
6 Section 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) stipulates that an appeal shall not be brought from a judgment of the Court constituted by a single judge, being a judgment that is interlocutory in nature, unless the Court or a Judge gives leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Although s 24(1A) does not purport to qualify or limit the Court's discretion (see D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 399 in the joint reasons for judgment of Sheppard, Burchett and Heerey JJ), the Courts have developed general principles which inform the exercise of the discretion to refuse or grant leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The rationale for those principles is the public interest in the efficient administration of justice, and the maintenance of 'the integrity and vigour of the procedures of the court, including as they do, the immediate involvement of the judge at all stages in the progress of cases to trial' ( Bomanite Pty Ltd v Slatex Corp Australia Pty Ltd (1991) 104 ALR 165 at 173, per Gummow J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">One consequence sought to be avoided is the expansion of expensive and delaying pre-trial litigation involved in appeals on issues of practice and procedure, and the concomitant reduction in the authority of the trial judge, should such appeals be frequently entertained ( Bomanite at 176, per French J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">7 At least for those reasons, this Court has held on a number of occasions that typically a party seeking leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment ought to establish, first, that in all the circumstances, the decision from which leave is sought to appeal is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant the same being reconsidered by the Full Court, and secondly, that substantial injustice would result if such leave was to be refused, supposing the decision to have been wrong: see D&eacute;cor at 398.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">That those two questions were the touchstone of exercise of discretion in matters of this kind was common ground between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I observe that it is well accepted that those criteria are not to be applied rigidly or fixedly, and the Court must bear in mind all of the circumstances of the particular case: see in that regard Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Phillip Morris Incorporated [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 177, where Gibbs CJ, Aickin, Wilson and Brennan JJ said:
 
 'For ourselves, we believe it to be unnecessary and indeed unwise to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The circumstances of different cases are infinitely various.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">We would merely repeat, with approval, the oft-cited statement of Sir Frederick Jordan in re the Will of F B Gilbert (dec) (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 318 at 323: 
 
 
 
 "...I am of the opinion that...there is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a point of practice or procedure and an exercise of discretion which determines substantive rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">In the former class of case, if a tight rein were not kept upon interference with the orders of Judges of first instance, the result would be disastrous to the proper administration of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The disposal of cases could be delayed interminably, and costs heaped up indefinitely, if a litigant with a long purse or a litigious disposition could, at will, in effect transfer all exercises of discretion in interlocutory applications from a Judge in chambers to a Court of Appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">"
 
 
 
 ...It is safe to say that the question of injustice flowing from the order appealed from will generally be a relevant and necessary consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">' 
 

8 It was the Music companies' contention that the orders of Moore J, from which leave to appeal is now sought, determined matters of practice and procedure within the foregoing statements of principle, involving as they did the obligation of Ms Hemming to submit to cross-examination on affidavits made by her in early April of this year, and to file a separate affidavit disclosing the assets of Sharman Networks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Those obligations were said to be no different in principle to any other interlocutory procedural order of the court, whether made pre-trial or during a trial, requiring parties to swear affidavits, to answer questions in cross-examination and to provide documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">On the question of what constitutes 'substantial injustice' for the purposes of determining an application for leave to appeal, counsel for the Music companies placed particular reliance upon the decision of the Full Federal Court delivered earlier in the primary proceedings, which denied leave to appeal from a decision by Wilcox J refusing to set aside Anton Piller orders that his Honour had earlier made: Brilliant Digital Entertainment Pty Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (2004) 63 IPR 373.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">I will refer further to that authority shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">9 The Sharman applicants sought to emphasise the existence of practical burdens imposed by the orders made by Moore J on 17 November 2005, although in reality it was principally with respect to the order for cross-examination of Ms Hemming to which that assertion was directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">They maintained that the requirement to appear for cross-examination was not analogous to the 'routine steps' of swearing an affidavit during the normal course of a trial and entering the witness box to answer questions related to its contents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Rather, the requirement to be cross-examined on an asset disclosure affidavit was said to be 'at the extreme end of the Court's armoury', by virtue of the fact that the making of an order for cross-examination on an affidavit of this kind is predicated upon the Court having implicitly found the deponent of that affidavit to be in contempt of court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">I was referred by the Sharman applicants to an earlier Full Federal Court decision in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Wong [2002] FCAFC 327 in support of their submission that since the present circumstances give rise to an important question of principle, leave to appeal should be readily granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The parties' respective submissions concerning material matters bearing upon the justification or otherwise for the grant of orders ancillary to the Mareva relief and my incidental observations 
 
10 The affidavit filed in support of the application for leave to appeal by Mr Rohan Higgins, the solicitor for the Sharman applicants, contained the following broad submission under the heading '[i]njustice if leave is refused':
 
 'If leave to appeal is not granted then the orders of Moore J will operate and will have to be complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Any subsequent challenge to those orders would then be futile and academic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The orders are interlocutory in form but final in the result in relation to the issues raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">' 


So much is correct as a general statement as to the consequences of his Honour's orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">However, the nature and context of the application for leave here involved in practical terms an appeal, or virtually so, as will hereafter emerge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 

11 The Music companies contended that the Sharman applicants' submissions proceeded in reality 'on the erroneous basis that every interlocutory decision that requires a party to do an act will be automatically susceptible to leave to appeal and to being stayed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Music companies' position was that the orders requiring Ms Hemming to file an affidavit disclosing the assets of Sharman Networks, and to attend for cross-examination on the affidavit she had earlier sworn as to disclosure of her assets, were merely procedural in nature and therefore, incapable as such of determining any final rights of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">So much accorded with Moore J's understanding of the nature of those orders, as indicated in [30] of his Honour's reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">12 The primary submission made by the Music companies as to why leave to appeal ought not to be granted related to the failure of the Sharman applicants to adduce evidence demonstrative of the claim that they would suffer 'substantial injustice', should leave be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The Music companies rejected any notion to the effect that the mere fact of Ms Hemming being compelled to swear an affidavit as to disclosure of Sharman Networks' assets, and to attend for cross-examination upon her own disclosure affidavits, without more, amounted to 'substantial injustice', in the sense that such expression has been used in numerous authorities concerned with the grant of leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Reference was made to Gerlach v Clifton Bricks Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 22 ; (2002) 209 CLR 478, in which Gaudron, McHugh and Hayne JJ, in a different context, considered that the bare proposition that an order mandating 'trial by judge alone, as opposed to trial by judge and jury, can amount, without more, to a substantial wrong to a party or to a miscarriage of justice, [was] a startling proposition'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The reality of the dilemma in which the Court is placed by the present application is the need for consideration in some depth of the matters to which attention has been drawn by the Sharman applicants, before determining whether leave to appeal ought formally to be granted to appeal in the first place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Sharman applicants relied upon a further passage from the majority's reasons for judgment in Gerlach at [13], as follows:
 
 'The principles governing the grant of leave to appeal against interlocutory orders are well established...If it is plain that wrong principle was applied by the judge considering the application, it may well be that leave should be granted...' 
 

13 The Music companies, for their part, placed particular reliance upon the joint reasons for judgment of Black CJ and Stone J in Brilliant Digital for the approach that they contended ought to be adopted in my consideration of the present application for leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In refusing leave to appeal from Wilcox J's decision to decline to set aside earlier Anton Piller orders that had been made in the course of the subject litigation, their Honours were said not to have considered at all the merits of the contemplated appeal there in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The following passages appearing at [7]-[8] and [13]-[14] of their Honour's reasons for judgment in Brilliant Digital were asserted by the Music companies to be apposite to the present application: 
 
 '[7] In our view these matters [the matters contended by the applicants to amount to substantial injustice] would not, either individually or cumulatively, occasion injustice to the applicants of such a character and to such a degree as to justify the grant of leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">While it is neither necessary nor appropriate to attempt to define the concept of substantial injustice some observations may be ventured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The flexibility of the principles governing the grant of leave to appeal indicates that the concept of substantial injustice must also be flexible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The requirement of leave to appeal indicates, however, that substantial injustice requires something more than that the subject decision is incorrect, otherwise the criterion would be superfluous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The qualification of "injustice" by "substantial" points to a detriment that, while not necessarily irreparable, is more than mere inconvenience or delay in the exercise of a right .</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 
 [8] The distinction between interlocutory decisions concerning matters of practice and procedure and those that concern the substantive interests of the parties recognises both the greater likelihood of an incorrect decision as to a substantive right causing substantial injustice and the importance of preserving a judge's power to supervise the orderly preparation of a matter for trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">In determining whether there has been substantial injustice it is appropriate for the court to take these factors into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The need to keep a tight rein upon interference with orders at first instance that do not determine substantive rights has even more force today in the context of procedural reforms and active case management undertaken with a view to the early identification of the real issues between the parties and the expeditious and efficient resolution of them... 
 
 [13] The challenged orders were plainly directed to matters of practice and procedure and did not determine any substantive rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">They were directed to the capture and preservation of certain data and information and this purpose has now been effected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Importantly, the applicants for leave do not seek to reverse this by destruction of the material seized pursuant to the challenged orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The primary judge has now made orders relating to the use of the material seized including its safekeeping by an independent party and, subject to appropriate confidentiality undertakings, the making of a safety or backup copy of the material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Orders have also been made granting preliminary access to the material for the purpose of any application that includes material not falling within the challenged orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The music companies are to have only such access to the seized material as would be normally available on discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">This shows that there is presently in train an orderly process for the management of the seized material in which the interests of both parties will receive due consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
 [14] In these circumstances we are far from satisfied that substantial injustice would follow from refusing the application for leave to appeal and, on that basis, we would refuse leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">That being so we do not propose to comment on the correctness or otherwise of the decision of the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Nothing we have said should be taken as suggesting that the making of the challenged orders was not a serious matter requiring very careful consideration by the primary judge; plainly, whether or not the applicants are correct in their contention that his decision was erroneous, the application for the challenged orders and the subsequent application to set them aside did receive consideration of that character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">' 
 

 (The emphasis appearing in [7] above in non-italics is mine).</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 

14 The Music companies contended that the orders made by Moore J were truly interlocutory in nature, rather than substantial in effect, being directed to 'the capture and preservation' of assets of the Sharman applicants pursuant to the Mareva relief granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">They pointed out that Moore J had reached his decision to impose those orders after careful application of the relevant legal principles, with due consideration of the lengthy evidence put before him by both parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Moreover, Moore J was said to have made it clear in [39] of his reasons for judgment that any cross-examination would be subject to the control of the Court, thereby limiting any prejudice that may be suffered by Ms Hemming or the other applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In those circumstances, counsel for the Music companies further contended that the applicants had failed to show that the obligations imposed upon them by Moore J amounted to anything greater than 'mere inconvenience'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">On that footing, the Music companies concluded that the Sharman applicants had failed to overcome the threshold requirement of establishing substantial injustice, and that leave to appeal should be refused on that basis alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Acceptance of that proposition was said to have the consequence realistically that consideration of the draft grounds of appeal from Moore J's judgment as formulated by the Sharman applicants, would not be necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">There is considerable force in those submissions of the Music companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">15 The Sharman applicants submitted that Brilliant Digital was distinguishable from the present circumstances because in the former instance, the orders the subject of application for leave to appeal arose from an Anton Piller order that had already been executed, but in the present case, Ms Hemming was yet to be cross-examined and had not, as at the date of hearing of the application, sworn an affidavit for instance on behalf of Sharman Networks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">I should interpolate to record that subsequent to reserving judgment on the question of leave to appeal, the Sharman applicants applied for a stay on Moore J's order requiring Ms Hemming to file that affidavit, and that I refused to grant that stay, but made orders requiring the affidavit to be left in a sealed envelope to be opened only upon further order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Because a Full Court on appeal is in a position to intervene in relation to the subjection of Ms Hemming to Moore J's orders, and because those orders were made, on the Sharman applicants' case, erroneously by his Honour, it was contended by the Sharman applicants to be unjust if leave to appeal was not to be granted in relation to his Honour's orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">16 The Sharman applicants further submitted that the Full Court 'regularly' grants leave to appeal where it can be shown that the exercise of a discretion has miscarried, and where that miscarriage in the exercise of a discretion involves an important question of principle, citing as authority Wong at [22].</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In Wong , the Full Federal Court held that the primary judge had failed to correctly apply the relevant legal test grounding the order made below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">No mention was made by the Full Court of the need to establish 'substantial injustice' before a grant of leave to appeal is to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Counsel for the Music companies submitted in response that Wong was of no assistance, since it was a decision made as a result of the primary judge having ordered the filing of interrogatories in the absence of evidence from the party sought to be interrogated going beyond a 'mere allegation'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">So much was said to stand in contrast with the considerable array of evidence provided respectively to Wilcox, Lindgren and Moore JJ at various interlocutory stages concerning Ms Hemming's control of the Sharman companies and a related and involved trust estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In any event the Music companies submitted that the Court's decision in Wong must be read subject to the later reasons of the Full Court in Brilliant Digital , which required inter alia that 'substantial injustice' be shown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">There is in my opinion clear force in those submissions of the Music companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">17 Contrary moreover to the Music companies' primary submissions, the Sharman applicants contended that should leave to appeal be refused, they would indeed suffer 'substantial injustice'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">That was said to be because the order to cross-examine a deponent of a disclosure affidavit was an exceptional one, and because Moore J had failed correctly to apply the relevant principles in making the order, in that his Honour had not made a positive finding that the affidavit disclosure by Ms Hemming of her own assets was inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">In my opinion however, the reasons of the primary judgment, which I have extracted in [5] above of these reasons are in substance to that effect, or at least sufficiently so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">In any event, the making of an order requiring cross-examination on a disclosure affidavit was said by the Sharman applicants to be tantamount to a finding of contempt, or at least predicated upon such a finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">That latter contention would seem to be directed to an overstatement, in circumstances where the complaint was inadequate responses to the enforcement of orders made ancillary to Mareva relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">18 In support of those propositions of the Sharman applicants, I was taken to several authorities in the United Kingdom and Australia concerned with the making of orders for cross-examination on disclosure affidavits made in pursuit of compliance with a Mareva order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">19 Thus in Den Norske Bank ASA v Antonatos [1999] QB 271, Waller LJ (with whom Chadwick and Millett LJJ agreed) said in a passage at 290, upon which the Sharman applicants placed reliance:
 
 'It is finally important to recognise that it is only in exceptional circumstances that cross-examination will be ordered on an affidavit sworn pursuant to a Mareva order: see House of Spring Gardens Ltd v Waite [1985] FSR 173 at 181, per Slade LJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The anxieties expressed by Scott J in Bayer AG v Winter (No 2) [1986] 1 WLR 540 relating to the court wanting no part of a star chamber process must constantly be borne in mind...' 
 

The passage from the reasons for judgment of Slade LJ in House of Spring Gardens, referred to by Waller LJ above, reads as follows:
 
 
 'I can very well see that on the particular facts of many cases --- perhaps most cases --- the court might not consider it "just and convenient" to order the cross-examination of a defendant who has filed an affidavit in purported compliance with a Mareva order, in a case where the plaintiff has not yet seen fit to issue a motion for contempt and is not seeking an order for the swearing of a second affidavit by the defendant concerned...' 
 

Whether there has occurred 'purported compliance with a Mareva order' must surely be viewed in terms of substance as well as mere form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Lord Justice Slade made those remarks in the course of overruling the decision of Scott J at first instance, which decision had been to the effect that a court did not have the power under s 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (UK) to make an order requiring cross-examination ancillary to compliance with a Mareva order, in the absence of circumstances whereby a justiciable issue is before the Court in respect of which the evidence of the deponent is relevant to the resolution thereof, for instance where the deponent of the disclosure affidavit was the subject of a contempt motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The 'anxieties expressed by Scott J', and also referred to by Waller LJ in Den Norske Bank , appear in Scott J's earlier reasons for judgment in Bayer AG v Winter (No 2) [1986] 1 WLR 540.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">In that latter case, Scott J was concerned with an application seeking orders that the defendant submit to cross-examination on a wide range of matters in aid of earlier Anton Piller and Mareva orders made by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Scott J referred to the scope of the cross-examination contemplated at 543 as follows:
 
 
 'Mr Prescott [for the plaintiff] made clear that the purpose of his proposed cross-examination of the first defendant is a free-ranging one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">He proposes to question him as to the whereabouts of his assets world-wide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">He proposes to question him as to his knowledge of and part played in transactions in counterfeit Baygon wherever they may have happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">' 
 

20 The primary proceedings in Bayer concerned allegations of an organised system for the sale of counterfeit Baygon insecticide products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">As at the time of the hearing before the presiding judge, no statement of claim had been filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Moreover, no evidence proving the allegations of sale of counterfeit Baygon was placed before the presiding judge for the purposes of the application, and at no stage had the defendant had an opportunity to confront any such evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Counsel for the plaintiff had indicated to the presiding judge that pending receipt of certain answers in cross-examination, the plaintiffs were minded subsequently to pursue contempt proceedings against the defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It was in those somewhat extreme circumstances, well removed from the present context here presented that Scott J made the following emphatic statement (at 544) in the course of refusing the order sought for the cross-examination of the defendant, being dictum upon which the Sharman applicants placed reliance in the present context:
 
 'Star Chamber interrogatory procedure has formed no part of the judicial process in this country for several centuries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The proper function of a judge in civil litigation is to decide issues between parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It is not, in my opinion, to preside over an interrogation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">
 
 The police, charged with the upholding of the public law, cannot subject a citizen to cross-examination before a judge in order to discover the truth about the citizen's misdeeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">How then, as a matter of discretion, can it be right in a civil case, in aid of rights which, however important, are merely private rights, to subject a citizen to such a cross-examination?</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">A fortiori it cannot be right to do so in a case where the plaintiff seeking the cross-examination of the defendant is holding itself free to use the defendant's answers for the purpose of an application to commit him to prison for contempt.</sentence>

I would respectfully withhold from any such somewhat characterisation of the present conduct of the Music companies in their pursuit of what seems to me to be both reasonable and authentic means designed to ensure that Mareva relief is afforded adequate facilitation and implementation in the context of Music companies' intellectual property protection and preservation upheld by the primary judge in the principal litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">
 

21 Senior counsel for the Sharman applicants asserted that nowhere in the reasons for judgment of Moore J is there a finding that the disclosures made by Mr Gee of the assets of the relevant two Sharman companies were incomplete, or that the disclosures by Ms Hemming in her affidavits as to her own assets were incomplete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">I would first observe that any finding of Moore J on the completeness, or otherwise, of Mr Gee's disclosure affidavits could not possibly have any bearing upon the appropriateness of his Honour's order requiring Ms Hemming to attend for cross-examination on her own affidavits, and any suggestion to the contrary is in my opinion incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Moreover, any such conclusion begs the question as to the operation of the notion of 'incomplete', and the context in which it is used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The theme of the primary judge's concern was more in the nature of inadequacy and lack of clarity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Senior counsel for the Sharman applicants asserted that the Music companies had not demonstrated that Ms Hemming's assets included what he termed 'the beneficial interest in the Sharman companies' or that the 'loan transaction with TIL was a sham'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">A present concern of the Music companies is indeed with the beneficial ownership of funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">In the case of tangible and intangible assets subjected to the interposition of a complexity of offshore established companies and trust estates purportedly controlled by an offshore trustee corporation, the task of gaining access to and control of those assets, in order to enforce onshore court judgments and orders, can be an expensive and formidable undertaking for a successful litigant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It was in the light of the complexity and opacity concerning Ms Hemming's apparent employment of a Vanuatu trust instrument that the primary judge observed for the time being as follows at [36]:
 
 '... it is, in my opinion unnecessary for me to resolve some specific issues concerning that structure which were the subject of argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">One was whether [Ms Hemming] has a beneficial interest in the Sharman trust or at least has an interest which should have been identified in her disclosure affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">' 
 

22 Senior counsel for the Sharman applicants submitted that having failed to make a finding on this point, the primary judge appeared to have concluded that the power to order cross-examination should be exercised in order to allow the matter of any such beneficial ownership to be further explored, his Honour observing in that context at [36]:
 
 'If this issue [was] explored in cross-examination then the Court will be left with a greater measure of certainty about whether she does [have an interest in the Sharman companies per medium of the Sharman trust].</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">' 
 

23 In further response to the primary judge's endeavours to distil an expedient means for the ascertainment relevantly of beneficial ownership, it was contended by the Sharman applicants that in circumstances such as the present, an order for cross-examination of a deponent 'cannot be made unless the Court is affirmatively satisfied that there has been a non-disclosure', all that being said to have involved 'a resolution of the arguments expressly eschewed by Moore J in [36] [of his reasons]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">I have difficulty with that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">In the context of his Honour's review of some of the offshore as well as onshore transactions, his Honour had made the significant finding, along the way as it were, that the 'evidence ... suggest[s] a loan was made after the property was purchased...' and also that 'a loan was not secured by a mortgage'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Consequently his Honour was able to observe at [37] that '... real doubts arise about, and uncertainty surrounds, the reason why this transaction took place when it did, and whether the moneys transferred to TIL were, in truth, in satisfaction of a loan or continues to constitute an asset of, and requires disclosure by, [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">' In the circumstances I have thus far recorded, that was an apposite observation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">24 All that was referrable of course to the implications of the payment of $1,116,405.63 by Ms Hemming to TIL, following the sale of her Sydney residence on 4 February 2005; that payment appears to have been made out of the proceeds of a sale of that residence, which was effected for the gross price of $2,100,000 to a person identified by the evidence as an accountant of certain of the Sharman companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">There was no sufficiently detailed or otherwise cogent evidence as to who exercised the substantial or underlying control of decision making of TIL, or as to the basis of or reasons for such alleged indebtedness having crystallised in the first place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The state of the evidence as to the control of TIL was itself the subject of disputation before Moore J and senior counsel for the Sharman applicants sought to attribute error to his Honour's judgment for the further reason that he had failed to make a finding as to Ms Hemming's control, or otherwise, of that entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The Sharman applicants postulated that the 'remark' made by Lindgren J at [13] of his Honour's reasons for judgment in Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 that '[Wilcox J] accepted [in the course of granting the Mareva relief on 22 March 2005] that the Sharman Companies were controlled by Ms Hemming by reason of a "client services agreement" between her and TIL dated 8 April 2002' was an 'unsure foundation for any finding of control of the Sharman trust or the Sharman companies [by Ms Hemming]', and was thus inappropriately or impermissibly relied upon by Moore J in formulating his reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">That submission lacked merit, particularly in the light of [31] of Lindgren J's reasons for judgment in which his Honour paraphrased the two-fold acceptance, given in cross-examination by the solicitor acting for Sharman License and Sharman Networks in their application before Lindgren J, that TIL as trustee of the Sharman trust was the ultimate beneficial owner of all the shares issued in Sharman License and Sharman Networks, and moreover that Wilcox J had himself appeared to accept that in consequence of the client services agreement, Ms Hemming 'controlled the Sharman trust'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">25 The Music companies had submitted to Moore J that given the evidentiary shortcomings on a subject readily susceptible to documentary demonstration, inclusive of banking records I might add, there was in truth and reality no antecedent loan, that the transfer of those funds by Ms Hemming to TIL in Vanuatu constituted a sham transaction, and consequently that those monies remained her own property beneficially, and should have been identified and disclosed as such in her affidavit provided in the Mareva context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Once more, so it was asserted by the Sharman applicants, his Honour declined to make any concluded finding on the subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The point is however that his Honour had been able to infer from the surrounding circumstances I have already outlined that there was some force in the Music companies' submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">But in any event his Honour was of the view that he could permit cross-examination of Ms Hemming on and in relation to those matters because at least doubt existed in relation to that area of enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">26 In respect of that finding, the Sharman applicants referred to Moore J's rationale expressed at [37] of his reasons for judgment and emphasised it as is indicated in non-italics:
 
 'Greater clarity about this matter [being the transfer of funds to TIL on 4 February 2005] may arise from the cross-examination of [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">' 
 

From what I have already reviewed, there was ample justification for his Honour to have reached that view of the unusual transactional offshore circumstances in evidence before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It was submitted however on behalf of the Sharman applicants that so much did not imply that Moore J was satisfied that there had not been compliance with the order of the court to disclose assets by Ms Hemming, which affirmative finding was of course contended by the Sharman applicants to be a prerequisite to the making of an order for cross-examination; I was referred for comparison to Planet International v Garcia (No 2) (1991) 1 Qd R 426, where the following appears at 427 of Thomas J's reasons for judgment:
 
 
 
 'In the present case I am satisfied Mr Garcia has not adequately complied with the order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">On the material before me, he has provided a collection of some untruthful statements, non-disclosures and qualifications...' 
 

I was also referred, by way of further comparison, to the following observations of the Court of Appeal in England in Motorola Credit Corporation v Uzan (No 2) [2003] EWCA Civ 752 ; [2004] 1 WLR 113 at [147] :
 
 
 'The piecemeal, late, untruthful and manifestly incomplete disclosure which the defendants gave amply justified the view that cross-examination was just and convenient because it might reveal assets which would make the freezing order more effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">' 
 

But of course those respective findings related to differing matters and circumstances, and neither finding was intended to be definitively exemplary, such as to exclude the need for further exploration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">
 

27 My reading of his Honour's reasons here was that he was far from satisfied with the nature or extent of the purported offshore structures and transactions to the extent apparent from the evidence, involving as they did the creation of a trust estate somewhat cognate to what have often been described as 'blind trusts'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Concerns of that nature appear to have persuaded or assisted to persuade the primary judge of the need to order that Ms Hemming submit to cross-examination on her disclosure affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">In determining to take that approach, his Honour paid regard to the relevant authorities dealing with both the grant of Mareva relief, and the making of orders ancillary to the same, including orders requiring the swearing of disclosure affidavits and cross-examination on those affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">After reviewing the relevant principles enunciated in those authorities, his Honour concluded at [28]: 
 
 '...ultimately the cautionary words of the four members of the High Court in [ Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380 at 403-404] set out at [18] above must be heeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Orders made in the Court's ancillary jurisdiction must be founded on a doctrinal and principled basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">A Mareva order is protective of the Court's processes, including the efficacy of execution of those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Orders concerning disclosure affidavits and cross examination can, in turn, be made to render the Mareva order more efficacious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">This is the touchstone for determining whether leave should be given to cross examine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">A relevant consideration in determining whether leave should be given might, in an appropriate case, be the failure of the deponent of a disclosure affidavit to disclose assets completely or promptly or both.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">In such a case, leave might be given because doubts might arise about whether the deponent had understood and accepted the obligations and burdens imposed by the Mareva order and the ancillary order requiring the disclosure affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Cross examination might be appropriate to test whether the disclosure affidavits fully revealed all assets on which the Mareva order operated and which might be available to satisfy any judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">However, in other cases, other more significant factors might support the granting of leave to cross examine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">' 
 

The 'cautionary words' of the High Court in Cardile earlier extracted by his Honour at [18] of his reasons below referred to the need for courts to exercise caution in making Mareva orders and to only do so upon a principled basis, having regard to the impact that those orders may have on respondents and third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">
 

28 It was submitted nevertheless on behalf of the Sharman applicants that the premise upon which the application for an order for cross-examination order proceeded here was that Ms Hemming had breached the order requiring her to disclose her assets, and that the basis upon which the Music companies litigated the proceedings below was to seek to convince the primary judge that there had occurred inadequate disclosure, on the footing that Ms Hemming did have a substantial asset, namely beneficial interests in the Sharman companies, and further that the loan transaction with TIL was in truth a sham arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Those issues were to have been debated before his Honour at length below 'but were never resolved'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Certainly the premise upon which the order is sought, as I have already sought to explain, was an inadequacy of disclosure of such matters in circumstances that indicated the need for further exploration and inquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">29 It was next asserted by the Sharman applicants that the high point of his Honour's conclusion below, both as to the so-called 'putative ownership by Ms Hemming of the Sharman Trust' and as to 'the existence or otherwise of the loan made by TIL to Ms Hemming repaid in February 2005', was that there was 'a lack of clarity' about the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">My observation is however, that any such lack of clarity about the alleged loan and its repayment or partial repayment derives from its inherently commercially, inexplicable origins and purposes in the first place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">It was submitted therefore to be an unprincipled exercise of discretion for his Honour to have ordered cross-examination in circumstances where the Music companies had not convinced his Honour upon either of those conditions which they had raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">In truth, so the submissions continued, his Honour fell into the error of making an order for cross-examination in circumstances where no basis had been demonstrated to the Court to make such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">For reasons I have already ventured, the concerns relevantly expressed by his Honour were more than some mere 'lack of clarity'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">30 In conclusion therefore, it was the case of the Sharman applicants that Moore J failed correctly to apply the relevant legal principles in committing Ms Hemming to cross-examination on her disclosure affidavit, and that it must follow that the Sharman applicants would inherently suffer 'substantial injustice' if Ms Hemming be so required to submit to cross-examination in accordance with the relief granted by the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In short, the complaint was that Moore J gave leave for the cross-examination to take place because the Court might 'be left with a greater measure of certainty' [36], and further 'because cross-examination may lead to greater clarity' [37], and that so much exemplified errors in principle in the exercise of his discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Conclusions upon the principal matters raised 
 
31 In my opinion, and for the reasons I have largely foreshadowed in my observations upon the submissions already recorded, the application for leave to appeal brought by the Sharman applicants has not sufficient cogency to justify the grant of any such leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The case of the Music companies presented to the primary judge (Moore J) for relief of the nature and to the extent granted was sufficiently in line with established principle as to be clear from 'sufficient doubt'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">I do not think that the United Kingdom and Australian authorities establish inflexible requirements to the extent postulated by the Sharman applicants, in particular concerning the Court's jurisdiction to grant leave to cross-examine the deponents of disclosure affidavits in Mareva contexts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">His Honour's approach in particular to the issue of granting leave to the Music companies to cross-examine Ms Hemming was soundly justified in the light of the evidentiary circumstances concerning the Sharman applicants' offshore trust structure, and the circumstances of and context in which such a substantial sum of money was transferred to an offshore company in the amount and in the context that occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">32 It is readily apparent that the primary judge placed significant weight, and I think rightly so, upon the following findings made by Lindgren J in the context of the preceding interlocutory proceedings of Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 , being proceedings which I have referred to earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">At [15] of his reasons for judgment, Lindgren J observed as follows:
 
 'As noted earlier, the Sharman Companies were ultimately beneficially owned by TIL as trustee of the Sharman Trust, and, notwithstanding the reference to "discretion" and the right of termination, the client services agreement provided evidence before his Honour that TIL, including TIL as trustee of the Sharman Trust, was likely to act at the direction of Ms Hemming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Since TIL, as trustee of the Sharman Trust was the ultimate beneficial owner of all the issued shares in the Sharman Companies, there was evidence before his Honour to show that they were also likely to act at her direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">' 
 

Earlier, at [4], his Honour had observed:
 
 
 'On 4 February 2005, Ms Hemming and Richard Kilmer-Barber settled a sale of their home at Castle Cove in Sydney to John Simon Myers for $2,100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Title was transferred on 16 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Ms Hemming and Dr Kilmer-Barber continued to occupy the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Ms Hemming's interest in the home was apparently her only substantial asset within the jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">There was evidence before his Honour that Mr Myers occupied some role such as accountant or bookkeeper of the Sharman Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Ms Hemming was the Chief Executive Officer of the Sharman Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Out of the proceeds of sale, $1,116,405.63 was transferred to a bank account in Vanuatu... which is where the Sharman Companies are incorporated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">' 
 

33 After reviewing in some detail the Australian authorities relating to misuse or abuse of process and of Mareva orders, and also the evidence placed before him in the present segment of the proceedings, in particular that concerned with Ms Hemming's apparent control of Sharman Networks, and Wilcox J's conclusions thereon, Moore J expressed his satisfaction that Ms Hemming should be required to swear a disclosure affidavit in relation to Sharman Network's assets, largely for the reasons I have already canvassed and which I will reproduce below, the same having been the focus of much of the respective parties submissions made in the present interlocutory proceedings (at [36] and [37]):
 
 'This leads to a consideration of whether [Ms Hemming] should be cross examined on her affidavits concerning disclosure of her assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">In my opinion, such an order should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The evidence points clearly to the structure reflected in the Sharman trust and the arrangements in Vanuatu more generally, having been established by [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Counsel for the applicants described that structure as opaque.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">This is in an apt description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">However, it is, in my opinion, unnecessary for me to resolve some specific issues concerning that structure which were the subject of argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">One was whether the fourth respondent has a beneficial interest in the Sharman trust or at least has an interest which should have been identified in her disclosure affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Not only is the evidence on this issue likely to be incomplete ([Ms Hemming] has proffered no evidence and almost certainly the applicants do not have all relevant records - they do not even have the trust deed) but it is also by no means clear to me how the law of Vanuatu would operate on the arrangements revealed, to this point, by the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">It would be unsatisfactory, dealing with the type of issues presently under consideration, to proceed on the basis that the law in that country can be presumed to be the same as the law of Australia: see The Parchim [1918] AC 157 at 161.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The findings of Wilcox J... point towards a conclusion that she does have such an interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">If this issue is explored in cross examination then the Court will be left with a greater measure of certainty about whether she does.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">
 
 The transfer of the property by [Ms Hemming] to another... has several unusual features.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">It occurred at a time when final submissions were being made in the primary proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Registration of the transfer occurred five days after the applicant's final submissions were served on the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">One can infer that the strengths and weaknesses of the respective cases would have been apparent to the parties and those advising them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The transferee was to a person associated with [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">He was an accountant who had work [sic] for the Sharman companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">A significant part of the proceeds of the sale were paid to [TIL]...</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">This was in settlement of what was said to be a loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">While some of the documents in evidence can be viewed as supporting the existence of a loan, they nonetheless suggest a loan was made after the property was purchased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">That, itself, is unusual, though one must accept there may be an explanation for this including, as counsel for [Ms Hemming] pointed out, that the funds lent replaced bridging finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">But the evidence suggests that a loan was not secured by a mortgage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In all, real doubts arise about, and uncertainty surrounds, the reason why this transaction took place when it did and whether the moneys transferred to TIL were, in truth, in satisfaction of a loan or continues to constitute an asset of, and requires disclosure by, [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Greater clarity about this matter may arise from the cross examination of [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">' 
 

34 With respect to the carefully as well as forcefully presented submissions made to the Court by senior counsel for the Sharman applicants, I am unable to distil material or significant error in the approach of the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">It was readily to be inferred by the primary judge, from the material placed before his Honour, that Ms Hemming did exercise what his Honour described as a central role in relation to the business of Sharman Networks, and moreover that Mr Gee, who was put forward by the Sharman applicants as having performed that role, was '... only in form an appropriate person' to have provided the principal affidavit evidence on behalf of the Sharman companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">I have not found the observations appearing in the English authorities, to which I have been referred by the Sharman applicants, and which I have extracted, to be of assistance, at least in contextual circumstances such as here involved, where the Sharman applicants have resorted to offshore transactions bearing no evident commercial significance, at least of transparency, and did so, in part, co-incidentally upon the unsuccessful involvement of the Sharman parties and their entities in the very substantial Universal Music litigation which concluded on the question of liability on 5 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">At least in circumstances such as those, the description 'Star Chamber interrogatory procedures' is inapposite.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Moreover in line with the observations made in Brilliant Digital , the orders here complained of are in substance at least presently concerned with 'matters of practice and procedure', and not 'substantive interests of the parties'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">35 Largely upon the footing of the foregoing findings, and his Honour's further findings as to the Sharman companies' principal deponent of affidavit evidence (being Mr Gee) having been '... only in form an appropriate person', though not in substance, and instead his having been essentially 'a cipher', I am unable to accept otherwise than that the primary judge was correct in his view that '[i]t is not possible to be affirmatively satisfied that [the disclosure]... is now complete', and further, in pointing out that Mr Myers' testimony did '... not provide sufficient assurance that Mr Gee's affidavits can, on their face, be accepted as constituting a full disclosure'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">36 In the light of my preceding discussion and analysis I also think that his Honour was right to have concluded in the following terms at [39] in the course of rejecting the Sharman applicants' contention that the subjection of Ms Hemming to cross-examination amounted to an abuse of the Court's process:
 
 'I accept that the [Music companies] would wish to ascertain who are the real and effective controllers of the Sharman companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">I also accept that this may become a matter about which questions might be asked if the orders sought by the applicants are made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">However if that becomes a legitimate area of cross examination (bearing in mind that any cross examination will be subject to the control of the Court) it will be for a legitimate purpose and not an illegitimate and collateral one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">I do not accept the criticisms of the way the [Music companies] identified and characterised the breaches of the disclosure order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">In particular, [Sharman License and Sharman Networks] elected to provide the disclosure affidavits required of them from a person appropriate in form but not in substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The [Music companies], who necessarily cannot be certain from their own knowledge of the matters to which the disclosure affidavits related, were entitled to review critically the affidavits proffered by [those Sharman companies].</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">All the more so given the opaque structure reflected in the Sharman trust and the arrangements in Vanuatu more generally and referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">While some of the criticisms were not significant, they included the failure to disclose significant sums held by lawyers on trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">I am not satisfied that the application should be dismissed for the reasons advanced by the [Sharman applicants].</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">' 
 

37 In making order 3 on 17 November 2005, it was submitted that Moore J also fell into error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The effect of order 3 was said to extend the 'freezing order' to the assets of Sharman Licence, which was erroneous because his Honour had overlooked the implications of the circumstance that Wilcox J had found in the main proceedings that such company had been completely successful and the claims made against it had been wholly dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Thus at [40], his Honour held as follows:
 
 'In view of (Wilcox J's) conclusions concerning the liability of [Sharman License], no such order should be made concerning that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">' 
 

It was apparently common ground moreover that Sharman Licence was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sharman Networks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">So much was said by the Sharman parties to have been 'entirely overlooked' when his Honour concluded at [40] of his reasons as follows:
 
 
 '... the proposed order is intended to bind existing respondents and prohibiting them from "causing or permitting any wholly-owned subsidiary" from dealing with its assets subject to the exceptions in the order as originally formulated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">This appears to me to be an appropriate extension of the original Mareva order and will ensure that assets of the respondents held, indirectly, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, will be controlled in the same way and for the same purpose as assets directly held to which the Mareva order presently applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">' 
 

I am unable however to comprehend why Sharman License's subsidiary status in relation to Sharman Networks should exclude it from the operation of the order of the Court below, which understandably was so framed as to extend to 'any wholly owned subsidiary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">' As pointed out by the Music companies, such an order does not have the effect of extending the Mareva order to Sharman License's assets, per se , but rather, the order prevents 'Sharman Networks from causing its subsidiaries to dispose of their assets'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">38 In the result, I am of the opinion that the application of the Sharman parties for leave to appeal addressed in these reasons must be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.</sentence>

 The nature of the proceeding 
 

 
 1 The principal issue in this proceeding is whether the Victorian Arts Centre falls within the category of 'premises of State Government Departments and Instrumentalities', for the purposes of provisions in industrial awards relating to rates of payment for persons employed in cleaning those premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In turn, this depends upon whether the Victorian Arts Centre Trust, a statutory corporation established by the Victorian Arts Centre Act 1979 (Vic) ('the VAC Act'), is properly described as a State Government department or instrumentality, for the purposes of the award provisions.</sentence>

 2 The applicant seeks penalties, pursuant to s 178 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the WR Act') for breaches of the terms of two awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The first award is the Building Services (Victoria) Award 1994 ('the 1994 Award').</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The second is the Building Services (Victoria) Award 2003 ('the 2003 Award').</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In each case, the respondent is alleged to have failed to pay named employees amounts it was required to pay by a specified clause of the award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The applicant seeks an order, pursuant to s 178(6) of the WR Act, that the respondent pay to each of those employees the amount owing to him or her.</sentence>

 The Victorian Arts Centre Trust 
 

 
 10 The legislative history of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust ('the Trust') goes back at least to the National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Act 1956 (Vic) ('the 1956 Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The preamble to the 1956 Act recited that a power to reserve certain land as a site for a National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre had been given to the Governor-in-Council under the Melbourne South Land Act 1946 (Vic), and that it was expedient to make provision for the vesting of such land in a committee constituted for the purpose of raising funds and providing a suitable building on such site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Section 3(1) of the 1956 Act provided: 


 
 'For the purposes of raising funds for the erection of a suitable building on the land reserved under the Principal Act and for the erection of such a building on such land there shall be a committee which committee shall be a body corporate under the name of the " National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Building Committee " with perpetual succession and a common seal and shall be capable in law of suing and being sued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">' 
 
 
 11 Section 5 provided for the grant to the National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Building Committee ('the Building Committee') of land reserved as a site for a National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Section 8 made provision for part of the land concerned to be used as a road, without such use operating to dedicate it as a public highway, and for part of the land to be used for ornamental purposes, for which the City of Melbourne was to have responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Section 9(1) provided that the Building Committee would be entitled to the rents and profits of any land granted to it by the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">


 
 12 The 1956 Act was amended by Act No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">6522 of 1959.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The amendments included the insertion among the powers of the Building Committee of the power to borrow on terms and conditions approved by the Treasurer of Victoria and the addition of a power, granted to the Treasurer of Victoria, to guarantee the repayment of any sum borrowed by the Building Committee with the Treasurer's approval and any interest on such sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">


 
 13 By s 12(1)(b) of Act No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">8249 of 1972, the Building Committee was renamed the Victorian Arts Centre Building Committee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">


 
 14 The Trust was established by the VAC Act, which came into operation on 13 March 1980.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Section 4 provided: 


 
 '(1) There shall be established a body corporate by the name of the 
 Victorian Arts Centre Trust which shall have perpetual succession and 
 a common seal and shall be capable in law of suing and of being sued 
 and of taking purchasing holding demising selling transferring 
 conveying mortgaging or otherwise disposing of real and personal 
 property for the purposes of and subject to this Act and of being and 
 suffering all acts matters and things which bodies corporate may by 
 law do and suffer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 
 (2) Subject to the general direction and control of the Minister the Trust 
 shall be responsible for the management of the Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">' 
 
 
 15 The word 'Centre' is defined in s 3 of the VAC Act as including the relevant land, and the buildings and improvements erected on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">By s 2(a) and (b) of the VAC Act, the Building Committee went out of office on the day on which the VAC Act came into operation, and the Trust became its successor in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">By s 2(d) of the VAC Act, all property vested in the Building Committee became vested in the Trust on that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">


 
 16 The functions of the Trust are set out in s 5 of the VAC Act: 


 
 '(1) The functions of the Trust are&#8722; 
 
 (a) to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain 
 the Centre; and 
 
 (b) to present and produce theatrical performances, operas, plays, 
 dramas, ballets and musical and other performances and 
 entertainment of any kind at any place; and 
 
 (c) to promote the use of the theatres, concert hall and other 
 places of assembly by suitable persons and bodies; and 
 
 (d) to provide leadership in the promotion and development of the 
 performing arts; and 
 
 (e) to ensure the maintenance, conservation, development and 
 promotion of the State collection of performing arts material; 
 and 
 
 (f) to oversee the exhibition of performing arts material from the 
 State collection and make any performing arts material from 
 the State collection available on loan to persons or institutions; 
 and 
 
 (fa) to establish, maintain, conserve, develop, promote and exhibit 
 the public art collection; and 
 
 (fb) to make any object from the public art collection available for 
 study or loan to persons or institutions, subject to any 
 conditions that the Trust determines; and 
 
 (g) to carry on, whether within or outside Victoria, whether alone 
 or in association with any other person or persons and whether 
 or not in relation to the Centre, a business of providing 
 ticketing, inventory management of admissions, marketing and 
 related services; and 
 
 (h) to perform any other functions appropriate to the Centre as the 
 Minister may approve; and 
 
 (i) to carry out any other function conferred on the Trust under 
 this Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 (2) In carrying out its functions, the Trust must endeavour to contribute to 
 the enrichment of the cultural, educational, social and economic life of 
 the people of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">' 
 
 
 17 The powers of the Trust, conferred by s 6 of the VAC Act, are the sorts of powers ordinarily conferred on a statutory corporation, with the addition of some that might be considered unusual for a government body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">For example, s 6(2) confers on the Trust the following powers: 


 
 '(e) to apply for and hold any licence or permit under the Liquor Control 
 Reform Act 1998 or any other Act; 
 
 (f) to register, purchase or apply for or otherwise acquire either wholly 
 or in part any invention, copyright, trade-mark or other mark or 
 design, patent, patent rights and privileges, licences, concessions or 
 other like rights which in the opinion of the Trust will be of assistance 
 to the Trust in carrying out its functions and to sell, dispose of, use, 
 exercise and develop such rights or inventions or to grant licences or 
 privileges in respect thereof; 
 
 ... 
 
 (h) to install, use, work and maintain film cameras and projectors and 
 broadcasting and television apparatus, and to grant the right of 
 installing, using, working and maintaining the same within the areas 
 under its control upon such terms and conditions and subject to the 
 payment of such charges as may be determined by the Trust; 
 
 (i) to print or reproduce in any manner or form and to publish or to 
 arrange for the printing or reproduction or publishing of plays, music, 
 programmes, posters and advertisements and such other material as 
 the Trust may deem expedient and to acquire the copyright therein; 
 
 (j) to commission plays, compositions, musicals, ballets, operas or other 
 works;' 
 
 
 18 The Trust's borrowing powers, conferred by s 7 of the VAC Act, are confined to borrowing with the approval of the Treasurer and subject to such terms, conditions and limits as the Treasurer imposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Treasurer has power, given by s 7(3), to guarantee repayment and the payment of interest, charges and expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">


 
 19 By amendment to the VAC Act in 2000, s 14(4) provides that a person employed by the Trust is not, in respect of that employment, subject to the provisions of the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Vic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Also by later amendment, ss 3A and 3B of the VAC Act provide that the Trust has vested in it collections of performing arts material and artworks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">By s 18 of the VAC Act, the Trust may not sell or dispose of any item that is part of those collections without advertising its intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">If any objection is received, the decision whether to sell is one for the Minister, or a delegate of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">By amendment of the VAC Act in 1994, s 18A was inserted, to give the Trust power to make by-laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">


 
 20 It may be relevant to observe how the Trust sees itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In its annual report for 2003-2004, the Trust described itself as follows: 


 
 'Purpose and statutory functions 
 
 The core purpose of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust (the Trust) is to enrich the lives of Victorians --- culturally, educationally, socially and economically 
 ( Victorian Arts Centre Act 1979 Section 5 ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 The Trust's responsibilities include: 
 
 &#8226; to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Arts 
 Centre; 
 
 &#8226; to produce and present theatrical performances of any kind; 
 
 &#8226; to promote the use of the Arts Centre by the community; 
 
 &#8226; to ensure the maintenance, conservation, development, promotion 
 and exhibition of the State collection of performing arts materials 
 and the public art collection, as well as making material available 
 for study or loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 Our role 
 
 &#8226; providing leadership in the creation, presentation, promotion and 
 advocacy of the performing arts; 
 
 &#8226; stimulating curiosity and understanding of the performing arts; 

 &#8226; increasing accessibility and enjoyment of the performing arts; 

 &#8226; creating partnerships that increase the value and potential of the 
 performing arts; 
 
 &#8226; exercising responsible care and presentation of publicly owned 
 cultural assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 Our vision 
 
 Our vision is of a society that values the performing arts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">' 
 
 
 21 In two places on its web site, the Trust describes itself as: 


 
 'a statutory authority of the Arts Portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Arts Portfolio is 
 administered by Arts Victoria, a division of the Department of Premier 
 and Cabinet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">' 
 
 
 22 Further, on its web page, the Trust says: 


 
 'The Arts Centre is the flagship of the performing arts in Victoria, and the focal point of Melbourne's cultural precinct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The Arts Centre is owned by the people of Victoria, and we welcome people at large to experience all that the Arts Centre has to offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
 In assocciation [ sic ] with some of Australia's top performing arts companies, and an array of national and international companies, we present a unique diversity of arts and entertainment choices all year round.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Arts Centre also offers eating and exhibitions to appeal to every age, taste and budget.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">' 
 
 
 23 The Arts Victoria Act 1972 (Vic) creates the office of Director, Arts Victoria, and provides for the appointment of a body called the Victorian Council of the Arts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Section 4 of that Act provides, in relation to the Department of Premier and Cabinet: 


 
 'The objects of the Department under this Act are&#8722; 
 
 (a) to develop and improve the knowledge understanding appreciation 
 and practice of the Arts in Victoria; 
 
 (b) to increase the availability and accessibility of the Arts to the public of 
 Victoria; 
 
 (c) to encourage and assist in the provision of facilities to enable the Arts 
 to be performed or displayed; 
 
 (d) to continually survey and assess the position of the Arts in Victoria 
 and to report to the Parliament at least once in every year on the 
 condition of the Arts in Victoria and to suggest ways in which the Arts 
 may be further and better assisted; 
 
 (e) to administer the Acts and enactments for which the Minister is 
 responsible; 
 
 (f) to advise and co-operate with other Departments of the Government 
 public statutory authorities municipalities and other persons or bodies 
 concerned with the promotion or practice of the Arts in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">' 
 
 
 24 It is clear that the Trust is not a State Government department, for the purposes of the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in the award clauses with which this case is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">There is a clear contrast between the Trust and Arts Victoria, which is described as a division of what is undoubtedly a State Government department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The test for determining whether a particular body is an 'instrumentality' of a State, within the ordinary meaning of that term, is found in Re Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria; Ex parte State Public Services Federation [1992] HCA 53 ; (1992) 175 CLR 442 at 448, where the High Court said: 


 
 'It is well settled that union eligibility rules are to be interpreted liberally and according to their ordinary and popular meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">However, the expression "State instrumentality" is one that carries much the same meaning in popular usage as in a legal context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">That meaning directs attention to the purpose or end served, so that a body is a State instrumentality if it is empowered to and does, in fact, serve some State government purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">And that is so even if it is neither a servant nor an agent of the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">' [Footnotes omitted]
 
 
 25 Among the authorities cited for the central proposition is the passage in the judgment of Isaacs and Rich JJ in Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees' Union of Australia v Melbourne Corporation [1919] HCA 72 ; (1919) 26 CLR 508 at 530---531, where their Honours said: 


 
 'If a municipality either (1) is legally empowered to perform and does perform any function whatever for the Crown, or (2) is lawfully empowered to perform and does perform any function which constitutionally is inalienably a Crown function &#8722; as, for instance, the administration of justice &#8722; the municipality is in law presumed to represent the Crown, and the exemption applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Otherwise, it is outside that exemption, and, if impliedly exempted at all, some other principle must be resorted to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The making and maintenance of streets in the municipality is not within either proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">' 
 
 
 26 In the Anti-Cancer Council case, the court held that the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria ('the ACCV') was not a 'State instrumentality', within the meaning of that expression in a trade union's eligibility rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The ACCV was not under ministerial control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Its only function that might have been described as serving a State Government purpose was the receipt of reports and the keeping and compiling of a register, for which the ACCV received a small amount of government funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Significantly, there was no obligation imposed on the ACCV with respect to the reports it received or the cancer register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The court held that the ACCV fell within another limb of the rule of the trade union in question, which defined those eligible for membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">


 
 27 Counsel for the respondent relied on R v Industrial Court of South Australia; Ex parte Australian Broadcasting Commission (1976) 13 SASR 460.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia held that the Australian Broadcasting Commission ('the ABC') was not an 'instrumentality or agency of the Government of the Commonwealth', within the meaning of s 114 of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1972---1975 (SA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">At 284, Bray CJ, with whom Hogarth J agreed, referred to Electricity Trust of South Australia v Linterns Ltd [1950] SASR 133, in which it was held that the Electricity Trust of South Australia was a government instrumentality, as it managed the undertaking for the supply of electricity and the mining of coal in South Australia, exercised its functions on behalf of the Crown, and was the means or agency for managing a Crown asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">At 284---285, Bray CJ conceded that the ABC might be regarded as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, but expressed the view that it could not be regarded as an instrumentality of the 'Government' of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">His Honour took the view that the word 'Government', with a capital initial, in s 114 meant the executive government of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">At 285, his Honour examined various provisions of the statute creating the ABC, emphasising the degree of autonomy from the executive government enjoyed by the ABC (with ministerial control only over a small number of specified functions, or in some exceptional specified circumstances), and the obligation of the ABC to indemnify the Postmaster-General in respect of any claim for anything done by the Postmaster-General's Department at the request of the ABC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">His Honour also pointed out that there was nothing in the statute declaring that the ABC held its assets on behalf of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">At 285---286, Bray CJ also regarded as relevant the question whether the degree of ministerial control was sufficient to entitle the ABC to the shield of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Assuming it to have been decided correctly, the ABC case is readily distinguishable from the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">


 
 28 In the present case, one of the most striking features of the Trust is the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">By s 4(2) of the VAC Act, the Trust's management of the Victorian Arts Centre is expressly subject to the general direction and control of the relevant Minister of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The Trust can only perform functions outside those expressly conferred by s 5(1) if the Minister approves of such functions (see s5(1)(h)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The exercise of the Trust's borrowing power is only possible with the approval of the Treasurer, under s 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The extent of ministerial control is such that the Trust would be very likely to have the benefit of the immunity of the Crown from the application of legislation not expressed to bind the Crown, or from being sued or convicted of a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In determining whether a statutory authority has such immunity, the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control under its establishing legislation is of great importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">See Superannuation Fund Investment Trust v Commissioner of Stamps (SA) [1979] HCA 34 ; (1979) 145 CLR 330 at 347---350 per Stephen J, and State Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia [1986] HCA 62 ; (1986) 161 CLR 639 at 650.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">


 
 29 The first function of the Trust, listed in s 5(1) of the VAC Act, is to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The land and buildings comprising the Victorian Arts Centre are vested in the Trust, by virtue of s 2(d) of the VAC Act, and by virtue of the vesting of what was formerly Crown land in the Trust's predecessor, the Building Committee, by the 1956 Act.</sentence>

 30 The legislative history, and the terms of the VAC Act, suggest strongly that the principal purpose for the Trust's existence is to hold the title to, and to manage, a major public asset on behalf of the Crown in right of the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">That this is the purpose of the VAC Act is confirmed by reference to the speech of the Minister for the Arts upon the second reading of the bill that became the VAC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In the course of that speech, the Minister said: 


 
 'The Government's investment in the project to date has been substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Its commitment to it has been a strong one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">This Bill provides a means of protecting that investment by establishing an operating style that is flexible, business-like and expressly designed for the needs of a major performing arts centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The centre is not just a set of buildings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">' 
 
 
 31 This extract from the second reading speech also suggests that the powers to which I have referred in [17], which I have described as unusual for a government body, have been conferred on the Trust as a means of enabling the better performance by the Trust of its principal function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The unusual powers enable the Trust to act as an impresario and a promoter, so that it can do all that might be thought necessary to manage effectively the important public asset vested in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">When viewed in this way, the unusual powers do not detract from the Trust's otherwise clear status as a government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Further, the removal of the employees of the Trust from the area of operation of the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Vic), by s 14(4) of the VAC Act, is seen simply as a means of achieving the degree of flexibility thought to be necessary for the Trust to exercise its range of powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Again, it should not be thought that such flexibility is necessarily inconsistent with the Trust being a government instrumentality, especially when it is viewed in the light of the ancillary nature of the unusual powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">


 
 32 Another significant indicator that the Trust is established to serve a government purpose is the grant to it, by s 18A of the VAC Act of the power to make by-laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The delegation of legislative power suggests that the Trust carries on governmental activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">See State Bank of New South Wales at 651.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">


 
 33 The examination of the legislative history, and of the current state of the VAC Act, makes it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Trust is both empowered to serve, and does serve a State Government purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">That purpose is the control and management of a significant public asset, which successive governments of Victoria have wished to make available for the economic and cultural enrichment of the citizens of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The information on the Trust's web site confirms this view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The Trust therefore falls clearly within the ordinary meaning of the phrase 'State instrumentality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">


 
 34 Counsel for the respondent submitted that the expression 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award should not bear its ordinary meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">His submissions were based on the history of the making of the two awards and the circumstances surrounding them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">He also advanced a number of other arguments about the construction of the relevant provisions, including the argument that a purposive construction of them should be adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 The history and context of the awards 
 

 
 35 Prior to 1992, terms and conditions of employment in the contract cleaning industry in Victoria were regulated pursuant to Victorian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">By that time, there were two main awards regulating the contract cleaning industry, the Building Services Award and the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">


 
 36 In or about 1992, the Victorian Government began to contract out the cleaning of government premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">As a consequence, the applicant or one of its predecessor unions applied to the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria to vary the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The variation sought was the insertion of a clause that would ensure that the conditions in that Award, which were superior to those in the Building Services Award , would continue to be available to employees cleaning government premises in Victoria, although those employees were employed by contractors and not by the State of Victoria itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">On 21 September 1992, Commissioner Pimm made an order, inserting into the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award a new clause, designated as cl 1A Incidence of Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">So far as is relevant to this proceeding, that clause provided: 


 
 'The Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award applies to the whole of the State of Victoria for persons engaged in the provision of building services in the occupations of building attendant, caretaker, cleaner, lift attendant or security officer, howsoever designated, employed --- 
 
 (a) By a contractor engaged by a State Government Department or 
 Instrumentality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">
 
 
 37 On 29 October 1992, when the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria in full session made a new Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award , to supersede the former award of that name, this incidence clause appeared in Pt A of that award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">


 
 38 Counsel for the respondent contended that, both before and after the insertion of the incidence of award clause, cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre were employed by a contractor and were not paid any allowance referable to the Trust being a government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">He contended that the purpose of the incidence of award clause was solely to ensure that superior terms and conditions of employment enjoyed by cleaners employed by the State of Victoria continued to apply when the State contracted out the cleaning of its premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">


 
 39 Not long after October 1992, there was a substantial flight from Victorian state awards to federal awards, as unions attempted to avoid new Victorian legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The applicant attempted to obtain a federal award for cleaners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Employers in the industry opposed this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Although the applicant was successful in overcoming an objection that the Commission had no jurisdiction to make an award, the Commission refused to make an interim award sought by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">On 25 October 1993, a Full Bench of the Commission published a decision following a review of wage fixing principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Among the principles it laid down for the making of first federal awards was a principle providing that: 


 
 'In awards regulating the employment of workers previously covered by a State award or determination, existing State award rates and conditions prima facie will be the proper award rates and conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">' 
 
 
 40 Following negotiations about the making of a federal award for the contract cleaning industry, the applicant entered into a memorandum of agreement dated 16 March 1994 ('the memorandum of agreement'), with the Australian Building Services Association, the Property Services Council of Australia, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and Eski Cleaning Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">That memorandum of agreement provided relevantly as follows: 


 
 'The parties agree: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">To make a joint application for a Federal Award that preserves rates 
 of pay and allowances as they were prescribed for the contract 
 cleaning industry in the expired awards of the former Industrial 
 Relations Commission of Victoria, known as the Building Services 
 Award, the Building Services (State Government Departments &amp; 
 Instrumentalities) Award, the Miscellaneous Workers Post-Secondary 
 Education (TAFE) Award and the Cleaners and Domestic Arts 
 Assistants (Government Schools) Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">That the Award made prescribe common conditions of employment 
 for the industry, other than where to prescribe such common 
 conditions of employment would result in a reduction in income 
 contrary to Point 1 of this agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">
 
 It is acknowledged by the parties that the implementation of 1 and 2 
 of this agreement shall be staged as follows: 
 
 (a) An initial application to the Commission for a minimum rates 
 award, the scope and Incidence of that award being in similar 
 terms to the Incidence of the former Building Services Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">

 (b) A second stage where the paid rates applicable in the former 
 paid rates awards applicable to the cleaning industry are 
 incorporated as separate parts into the Building Services 
 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">' 
 
 
 41 On 16 March 1994, a representative of the applicant announced the memorandum of agreement to Deputy President Acton of the Commission, and sought the making of an award in accordance with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In the course of his submissions, the applicant's representative told Deputy President Acton: 


 
 'The award that I would be asking that the commission make, arising out of today's proceedings is a minimum rates award, the incidence of which is in similar terms to the incidence of the former Building Services Award of the former Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">There will be a second stage in the implementation of this agreement at which time the parties will approach the commission and seek to have the award which we would have made today, amended to incorporate rates of pay which were expressed in the former state awards known as the Building Services State Government Departments and Instrumentalities award, the Miscellaneous Workers Post-secondary Education TAFE Award, and the Cleaners and Domestic Arts Assistance Government Schools Award, and that will be the subject of subsequent application to the commission, and of course there will need to be detailed negotiations between the parties as to the final form of such variations to the award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">' 
 
 
 42 The applicant's representative also told Deputy President Acton that the proposed award reflected the situation as it was when the Building Services Conciliation and Arbitration Board and the Building Services State Government Departments and Instrumentalities Conciliation and Arbitration Board had been restructured by decision of the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria on 7 March 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The abolition of those boards by statute in August 1992 led to the introduction into the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award of the incidence clause to which I have referred in [36].</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The Commission made the consent award, which is the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">


 
 43 As had been promised to Deputy President Acton, a further application was made to the Commission to incorporate into the 1994 Award the specific rates derived from several former Victorian awards, including the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The Commission heard that application on 20 July 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The application was not opposed by representatives of employers, although two of them expressed concern about differential rates within the industry and foreshadowed discussions with a view to absorbing the specific rates into future general increases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Commissioner Bacon accepted the submission of the parties and invited them to submit an order for him to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">This was the origin of cl 8A of the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">


 
 44 This history might be of some assistance to the respondent's case if there were any evidence that the non-payment of rates specified in the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award to those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre had ever been the result of a conscious decision not to apply those rates, or an awareness that, for some reason, they were inapplicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">For present purposes, I am prepared to accept that the construction of an award can be affected by a common understanding of the parties to it about a particular state of affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">If such a common understanding existed when the award was made, it should not be departed from when the Court comes to construe the award at a subsequent time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Care must be taken, however, to distinguish a common understanding from common inadvertence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">If the only reason why the government instrumentality rates were not paid at the Victorian Arts Centre was that neither the union nor the employer adverted to the possibility that there was an obligation to pay them, no common understanding results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In order to have an understanding, it is necessary that there be a meeting of minds, a consensus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">There can be no meeting of minds, no consensus, if no-one has thought about the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">


 
 45 Such evidence as there is in the present case leads to the conclusion that it is only in recent years that the applicant has realised that there is a possibility that those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre have been underpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">There were several parties to the memorandum of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">There is no evidence that any of those parties held a view on the issue at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">In this respect, three significant witnesses gave evidence in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Dimitrios Demos was the Operations Manager of the company that became the contractor for the cleaning of the Victorian Arts Centre from the time the Trust took possession of it in 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">He worked for that company until 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">During that time, he became its State Manager for Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">John Lazzari was the State Manager for Victoria of a predecessor company of the respondent from 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">He had direct responsibility for overseeing the carrying out of the contract to clean the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">At the time of the transition from State to federal regulation of terms and conditions of employment in the contract cleaning industry, Mr Lazzari was State President of the Building Services Contractors Association of Australia, which he said was incorrectly described in the memorandum of agreement to which I have referred in [40] as the Property Services Council of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In that capacity, he was a signatory of the memorandum of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">John Grant was on the State Executive of the Building Services Contractors Association of Australia at the time of the transition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">None of these three witnesses gave any evidence suggestive of a common understanding between the applicant or its predecessor and any employer, or employer association involved in the contract cleaning industry, to the effect that the Victorian Arts Centre was not regarded as premises of a State Government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">It is clear that no-one adverted to the status of the Trust, and to whether it was a State Government instrumentality for the purposes of either the earlier State award or the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">


 
 46 It is not the case that the applicant has changed its mind and gone back on a common understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">It is the case that no common understanding ever existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">
 Other construction arguments 
 

 
 47 The adoption of a purposive construction of the 1994 Award does not assist the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Even if the purpose can be ascertained from the express statements of the subjective intentions of the parties to the process of making the 1994 Award, acceptance that the purpose was to reproduce the situation as it had been in Victoria does not answer the question whether there existed an obligation to pay the government instrumentality rates to those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The stated purpose of the memorandum of agreement was to preserve rates of pay 'as they were prescribed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">If it could be shown that some provision of the earlier Victorian award excluded those employed to clean the premises of the Trust, the stated purpose of the memorandum of agreement would not be fulfilled if the 1994 Award, which was the result of the agreement expressed in the memorandum of agreement, were to be construed as including the Trust's premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">No such provision existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">On no view can an examination of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award, by itself or in the context of other provisions of the 1994 Award, yield a purpose as specific as the exclusion of the Trust from the concept of a State Government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The purpose was to provide higher rates of pay for those employed in cleaning in the premises of 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The question remains whether that concept includes or excludes the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">


 
 48 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' had become a term of art in relation to industrial instruments operating in Victoria by the time the 1994 Award was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">To establish this proposition, he tendered a copy of the original print of the Metal Industry (Victorian Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Interim Award 1981 ('the Metal Industry Award'), dated 14 October 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Clause 2 of the Metal Industry Award provided: 


 '2 --- PARTIES BOUND 
 
 This award shall be binding upon members of The Amalgamated Metal Workers' and Shipwrights Union, Australasian Society of Engineers, the Electrical Trades Union of Australia, The Federated Ironworkers' Association of Australia and the Victorian Government Departments and Instrumentalities named hereunder in respect of their employees performing work covered by this award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">
 
 In Part 1: 
 
 Country Roads Board, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">
 Forests Commission of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">
 Her Majesty the Queen In Right of the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">
 Housing Commission, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">
 Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">
 Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">
 State Rivers and Water Supply Commission, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">
 
 In Part 2: 
 
 State Electricity Commission of Victoria 
 
 In Part 3: 
 
 Geelong Harbour Trust Commissioners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">
 Port of Melbourne Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">
 Portland Harbour Trust Commissioners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">' 
 
 
 49 Just how the making of the Metal Industry Award could operate to create a term of art for industrial instruments is unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The organisations that later amalgamated to form the applicant were not parties to the Metal Industry Award, and therefore played no part in the choice of bodies named.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Mr Lazzari, who was a signatory to the memorandum of agreement referred to in [40], gave evidence that he was not aware of the list in the Metal Industry Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">It is unlikely that the concept of a State Government department or instrumentality could be frozen in time by a specific listing in one award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In any event, the list included 'Her Majesty the Queen In Right of the State of Victoria', an entity apt to include all statutory bodies entitled to the immunity of the Crown in right of the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">On the basis that the Trust is such a body, it would be comprehended by the list in the Metal Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">


 
 50 Although three witnesses with long experience of the contract cleaning industry gave evidence on behalf of the respondent, no witness gave evidence to the effect that the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' had become a term of art in the industry, whether as a result of the Metal Industry Award or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">


 
 51 Counsel for the respondent attempted to rely on the capitalisation of the initial letter of the word 'Instrumentalities' in each of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, as well as in the earlier Victorian award, as indicative that a particular meaning of the word had been intended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Capitalisation of the initial letters of words in headings is a common practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Inappropriate capitalisation of the initial letters of words, when not used in headings, is also common.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">It is unlikely to indicate the use of a term of art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">In any event, if a conscious decision had been made to use the word 'Instrumentalities' as a term of art, the option of defining it in the award was available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">It is unlikely that whoever drafted the 1994 Award made a conscious decision to use a term of art, and to indicate that a term of art had been used solely by the use of an initial capital letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">I do not accept that the fact that the word 'Instrumentality' has a capital initial in the 1994 Award and the earlier Victorian award that replaced it can be said to be indicative of a term of art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">This is so, even when the word is contrasted with the word 'instrumentality' in the clause considered by the High Court in the Anti-Cancer Council case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">


 
 52 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that I should have regard to possible anomalies that might arise from the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award to high-rise buildings, occupied by a mix of tenants, only some of which were State Government entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">This argument is completely irrelevant to the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">There is no suggestion that the Victorian Arts Centre is occupied by any entity other than the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The question of multiple occupancy of buildings and the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award is dealt with in Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union v Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 408 , a judgment delivered subsequent to the hearing of the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">


 
 53 For these reasons, I am persuaded that the word 'Instrumentalities' when used in the composite phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award is used in its ordinary and natural meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">When so used, as I have already found, it encompasses the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">
 Conclusion and orders 
 

 
 54 It follows that the respondent has been in breach of its obligations, imposed by cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, to pay the allowances required by those clauses to its employees engaged in performing cleaning services at the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">


 
 55 Section 178(2) of the WR Act provides that multiple breaches of a term of an award, arising out of a course of conduct, are to be treated as a single breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Counsel for the applicant accepted that all breaches of the 1994 Award were to be treated as a single breach and all breaches of the 2003 Award were to be treated as another single breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">This involves the concession that each of the relevant clauses contains a single 'term', for the purposes of s 178 of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">I am prepared to accept this concession in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">


 
 56 The maximum penalty applicable is $10 000 for each breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">There has been an increase in the maximum amount, by amendment to the WR Act since the proceeding was commenced, but counsel for the applicant conceded that the earlier maximum is the appropriate one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">In fixing the appropriate penalty, I bear in mind that the real penalty for the respondent will be the necessity to make the payments of underpaid entitlements, together with interest, to each of the employees underpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">This will be an expensive exercise for the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">It will have an effect on the profitability of the contract under which the respondent is responsible for the cleaning of the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">I accept that that contract was negotiated without regard to the need to pay the allowances specified by the 1994 Award and the 2003 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Some reference was made to the possibility of renegotiating the contract in light of the outcome of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Whether that can be done, and the Trust can be induced to pay a greater sum in respect of work already done, I do not know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">I also accept that, at least until recent times, the breaches have arisen from inadvertence, and not from a deliberate intention to underpay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">No suggestion was made that the respondent had a record of prior breaches of awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The only aggravating factor appears to be the want of any contrition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">In his evidence, Mr Lazzari was very dismissive of the claim, describing it as 'frivolous'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Obviously, there was a need for the respondent to look more closely at its obligations, when the issue was first raised by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">


 
 57 It is also necessary to acknowledge the need for deterrence in an industry in which Mr Grant, who has held several offices in the Building Services Contractors Association over a long period, acknowledged that there is some non-compliance with awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">


 
 58 Taking all these factors into account, it is appropriate to fix the penalty at $2000 in respect of the breach of the term of the 1994 Award and $1500 in respect of the breach of the term of the 2003 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The usual order is that a penalty be paid to the party seeking its imposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">There was no submission that such an order would be inappropriate in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Pursuant to s 356 of the WR Act, there will be an order that each penalty be paid to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">


 
 59 I also propose to make an order that the respondent pay to each of the persons it employed at the Victorian Arts Centre the amount agreed to be outstanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">To each amount there should be added interest, pursuant to s 179A of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">In this respect, the applicant's claim is modest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Because of the difficulty of calculation of interest when it is payable on a series of payments that were due over a long period, the applicant has asked for interest only from 1 June 2003, ie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">on the total sum owed to each employee in respect of the two periods claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">The applicant calculated that interest only up to the date when the case was being heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">It should be calculated to the date of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">As to the rate, the applicant sought interest at 11 per cent per annum, that being the operative rate at 1 June 2003, pursuant to the Penalty Interest Rate Act 1983 (Vic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">It is appropriate to choose that rate for the reasons advanced in EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">2) (1998) 160 ALR 382 at 384, and Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1406 at [91] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The rate of interest was increased to 11.25 per cent from 26 June 2003, and to 12 per cent from 1 July 2004, but counsel for the applicant forwent any entitlement to a rate greater than 11 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The order that I make for payment to each employee will therefore include an amount of interest on the sum owing to that employee at 1 June 2003, at the rate of 11 per cent per annum (non-compounding), from 1 June 2003 to the date of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">


 
 60 The case is covered by s 347 of the WR Act, so no question of cost arises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">

1 The circumstances revealed in this application for preliminary discovery suggest there is a need for the Minister administering the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth) ("the AFP Act ") and the Commissioner of Police to address the procedures and protocols followed by members of the Australian Federal Police ("AFP") when providing information to the police forces of another country in circumstances which predictably could result in the charging of a person with an offence that would expose that person to the risk of the death penalty in that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Especially is this so where the person concerned is an Australian citizen and the information is provided in the course of a request being made by the AFP for assistance from that other country's police force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">This said, the application to this Court must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">It reveals no basis for a reasonable cause to believe that the applicants may have a right to obtain relief in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Any later proceedings brought on the bases foreshadowed in this application would be purely speculative in character or else would have no prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 The four applicants, Scott Rush, Renae Lawrence, Michael Czugaj and Martin Stevens, are members of a group of Australian citizens known as the "Bali nine".</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">All were arrested in Bali for alleged involvement in heroin trafficking to Australia, the arrests resulting from action taken by the Indonesian police in consequence of precise details provided to that police by members of the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Each of the applicants is now exposed to death penalty if convicted of the offences with which they respectively have been charged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It is the action of AFP members in providing that information to the Indonesian police and its foreseeable consequence that has prompted the bringing of this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">THE APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY DISCOVERY 
 
3 Order 15A rr 3 and 6 of the Federal Court Rules provide respectively for what is colloquially known as "identity discovery" and "information discovery": see generally Hooper v Kirella [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">I am empowered by our Rules to order identity discovery where (i) an applicant, having made reasonable inquiries, is unable to ascertain the description of a person sufficiently for the purpose of commencing a proceeding in this Court against that person; and (ii) it appears that some other person has, has had, or is likely to have knowledge of facts or possession of any document tending to assist in ascertaining who that person is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 Information discovery in contrast is discovery against the very person against whom relief may be sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It is tightly circumscribed in the requirements to be met before discovery may be ordered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">These are that:
 
 
 "(a) there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained; 
 
 (b) after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief; and 
 
 (c) there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">" 
 
 

5 Common to both species of discovery is a prospective proceeding which may be commenced in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Inherent in this possibility are the requirements that the proceeding will be (a) within federal jurisdiction and (b) in respect of a cause of action known to law which is not purely speculative in character and which is not devoid of prospects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">There is no difficulty in this matter in relation to the former of these requirements, some at least of the prospective causes of action being said to arise under Commonwealth legislation: see Judiciary Act 1903 , s 39B(1A)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It is the latter requirement, which requires the identification of a possible cause of action (in this case a legal wrong done to the applicants), that is problematic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">6 It is unnecessary for me to refer in detail to the growing body of case law on preliminary discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to the following.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The O 15A r 3 power to order identity discovery is not to be used in favour of a person who intends to commence merely speculative proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">A material factor in the exercise of the Court's discretion is the prospect of the applicant succeeding in proceedings against the person wished to be sued: Hooper v Kirella at [33].</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Information discovery under O 15A r 6 is significantly limited by the conditions imposed in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of that rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Subpar (a) requires that there be reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">While the threshold test under this subrule may be set at quite a low level: see Gull Petroleum (WA) Ltd v Tah Land Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1531 at [59] ; the test for determining whether the applicant has a reasonable cause to have the requisite belief is an objective one: see Hooper v Kirella at [39].</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Though it is not necessary to demonstrate a prima facie case, it is not enough merely to assert that there is, or is the mere possibility of, a case against the prospective respondent: Hooper v Kirella at [39].</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Importantly, as Hely J observed in St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 at [26]:
 
 "(d) belief requires more than mere assertion and more than suspicion or conjecture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting a proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Thus it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter or fact in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists, that would dispose of the application insofar as it is based on that cause of action: John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 679 ; BC200403021 at [13], [14], [17] and [73].</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">" 
 

7 While O 15 r 6 expressly contemplates "fishing", it equally requires that each of the limiting conditions prescribed in subpars (a), (b) and (c) must be established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Preliminary discovery cannot itself be used to remedy deficiencies in the satisfaction of the conditions themselves: Airservices Australia Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 886 ; (1999) 92 FCR 200 at [5] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">8 Before outlining the factual setting of this matter I should indicate that it has undergone a significant transformation since the hearing of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I gave the applicants leave to file supplementary submissions directed primarily to the prospective causes of action they might wish to pursue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">They have acted upon this leave and, in quite some degree, have recast their cases for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">This explains why matters which received some attention at the hearing are only dealt with cursorily in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">FACTUAL SETTING 
 
9 Much in the detail of what follows relates only to the first applicant, Scott Rush, and gives rise to potential claims unique to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">As will become apparent, the cases of the other three applicants arise from their involvement in events in which Scott Rush as well was implicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The evidence in this matter was given by way of affidavit and without cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">In relation to Rush's case I should also indicate that a number of affidavits have been read which expose significant conflicts of evidence between witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">I should indicate that I have not been asked in the circumstances to make findings in relation to contested issues of fact in the material before me, the respondent being prepared to accept that their resolution is for another day, if at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">10 The annexures to several of the affidavits contain documents derived from the Dossier (or book of documents) relied upon by the prosecutor as evidence in the prosecution of the second applicant, Renae Lawrence, in the criminal proceedings in the Denpasar District Court in respect of an offence under Art 82(1) of the Law of the Republic of Indonesia No 22 of 1997 concerning Narcotics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The Dossier contained documents obtained by Indonesian Police as part of their investigation and has been made a public document by order of the Indonesian Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Reference will be made below to translations of a number of these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">11 The four applicants are Australian citizens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">On 6 April 2005, Renae Lawrence and Martin Stephens travelled to Bali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Scott Rush and Michael Czugaj travelled to the same destination on 8 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">12 Prior to Rush's departure from Australia, his father, Lee Rush, became aware he may have been travelling to Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Lee Rush was concerned that Scott might have been travelling to Bali to be involved in illegal activity and, according to his evidence, he was determined to help save him from committing any offence in Bali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">13 Lee Rush contacted a barrister and family friend, Robert Myers, to seek advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Myers had acted for Scott Rush on a number of minor criminal prosecutions concerned, in the main, with dishonesty offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Myers in turn contacted a friend of his, Damon Patching, a member of the Queensland Police Service who was at the relevant time seconded to the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Before referring to the evidence of Mr Myers and Mr Patching, I foreshadow that there are important differences between each's account of their several conversations particularly in relation to what Mr Patching is alleged to have said would be done, and had subsequently been done, by the AFP at Sydney Airport in relation to Scott Rush.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">14 Myers' evidence is that he requested that Rush be detained at Sydney airport and prevented from leaving Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">He referred to Rush's prior convictions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It was the case that Rush was on bail at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Myers went on that if the AFP could not detain Rush he should be stopped at his point of exit and be advised that the AFP were aware he was "up to no good", that he would be watched in Bali and that it would be foolish for him to participate in illegal activity there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">15 Patching, according to Myers, said the AFP would talk to Rush if a passport alert ("a PACE alert") was activated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">He was later told by Patching that this had occurred and that Rush had been spoken to at the airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Myers then spoke to Lee Rush and told him that, given what the AFP had done, he and Lee Rush had done all they could conceivably do and there was no necessity for Lee Rush to go to Bali to stop Scott.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">16 Lee Rush's evidence of his conversations with Myers corroborated Myers' accounts and it was because of those conversations that he desisted from going immediately to Bali to stop his son committing any offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">17 Mr Patching's evidence was that in one of his conversations with Myers he indicated he would contact Ashley Durre, another Queensland Police Service Officer on secondment with the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It was agreed with Durre that Patching should arrange for a PACE alert to be placed on Scott Rush.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Patching contacted Federal Agent Osseily who handled PACE alert matters at Sydney Airport, who activated the alert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Osseily, Patching said, informed him he did not think "it was a goer" for the AFP to approach Scott and to warn him he was of interest to the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Patching said he knew at the time it would be unusual for police to make such an approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">When he later rang Robert Myers and was asked whether Scott Rush would be approached and spoken to by the police, Patching deposed he said that "may be looked at as a possibility ... depending on the circumstances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">He denied he gave any assurance that Rush would be approached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The next day Patching received a call from Federal Agent Collins at Sydney Airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Collins asked him whether Rush's bail conditions would prevent him leaving the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">After enquiries in Queensland, Patching informed Collins they would not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">He also told Collins that Lee Rush wanted Scott to be approached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Collins commented this was not usual practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Patching denied he gave Myers an assurance or undertaking at any stage that Scott Rush would be approached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">18 Mr Durre's affidavit corroborated Patching's evidence in his recall of conversations with Patching to the extent he was present at and overheard telephone conversations Patching had with others including Myers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">19 Mr Osseily's evidence described the PACE alert system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">It is maintained by the Australian Customs Service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">It is used by particular Federal and State agencies both as a means of gathering intelligence on persons entering or leaving Australia and also as a means of preventing certain targeted individuals from entering or leaving the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">20 Mr Osseily said he created the PACE alert on Scott Rush on the basis of information that his bail conditions prevented him from departing Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">He derived this information from Patching.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">21 Mr Collins, who was on duty at the AFP office at Sydney Airport on 8 April, gave evidence that he was informed that morning of the alert on Scott Rush and that the basis of it was that Rush's bail conditions stipulated he was not allowed to depart Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">He spoke to Patching and was told of Lee Rush's concern about Scott's visit to Bali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Collins then contacted the relevant Queensland State Police and ascertained that there were no bail conditions preventing him leaving the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">This evidence is not consistent with Patching's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">By that time the passengers would have commenced boarding the flight to Bali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">As he said in his own words:
 
 
 "16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">My conclusion at this stage was that there was no reason for Scott Rush to be detained and that he should be allowed to leave without being disturbed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">My view was that despite the concerns of Lee Rush, Scott Rush was an adult and there was no basis for detaining Scott Rush.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">I recall running my decision past my supervisor after outlining the results of my investigations and that my supervisor agreed with my decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">
 
 17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">I then contacted the Customs and advised the officer on duty that the AFP would be taking no further action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">" 
 
 

22 On 8 April 2005, Paul Hunniford, who was the AFP Senior Liaison Officer in Bali, sent a letter (translated into Indonesian) to the Indonesian National Police ("the INP") in Denpasar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It said (omitting formal and irrelevant detail)"

 Heroin couriers from Bali to Australia --- Currently in Bali

 The AFP in Australia have received information that a group of persons are allegedly importing a narcotic substance (believed to be Heroin) from Bali to Australia using 8 individual people carrying body packs strapped to their legs and back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">More specifically the information received that: 
 
 The group planned to conduct an importation in December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The group travelled to Bali in December 2004 but the importation was cancelled because there was not enough money to buy 'the stuff' and that they would be travelling again in 3-6 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The group returned to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">
 
 The couriers were given instructions not to smoke cigarettes for two weeks prior to travel as they would not be allowed to smoke on the return flight as they may appear nervous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">They were to carry body packs (containing white powder) back to Australia by using packs on both legs and the back supports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">They were also supplied back supports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The packs were to be tightly taped to the person's body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Members of the group were given expense money and told to change the money into local currency to allow them to buy oversized clothes and thongs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The clothes and thongs were not to have any metal on them to avoid the metal detectors at the airports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The couriers received pre-paid mobile telephones.</sentence>

24 James Watson, an AFP member and legal adviser to the Commissioner and to AFP members, has given the following evidence in relation to these two letters:
 
 "5.4 contrary to what has been widely reported in the media, the information concerning Scott Rush which is reflected in the abovementioned letters dated 8 and 12 April 2005 was not based upon information received from Mr Meyers [sic] or Mr Lee Rush via Senior Constable Patching.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Quite apart from the PACE alert placed by Senior Constable Patching, prior to Scott Rush's departure overseas on 7 April 2005 he (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Scott Rush) activated another PACE alert, which was handled by the AFP's case officer (Federal Agent Hingst) who had carriage of the AFP's extant investigation into members of the so-called 'Bali 9'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">It was the triggering of this alert which connected Mr Rush with eight other already identified persons of interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">It was information obtained in the course of this extant AFP investigation (including as a result of the activation of the PACE alert handled by Federal Agent Hingst) which caused Mr Rush's details to be included in the AFP letters of 8 and 12 April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">" 
 

25 Mr Watson also has stated that in sending the two letters to the INP the AFP were acting pursuant to what I will describe as the Police Cooperation Memorandum of Understanding with Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">26 Between 9 pm 17 April 2005 and 2 am 18 April 2005, the four applicants were among the nine Australians who were detained by the INP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">They were found in possession of what was alleged to be significant quantities of heroin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">A process of investigation had previously been initiated by the INP on 13 April in consequence of the 8 April letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">27 On 17 April 2005 the INP issued a formal "Investigation Order".</sentence>

<sentence id="s153">I have in evidence the order that relates to Renae Lawrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Similar orders, apparently, were issued in respect of the other applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The Lawrence Order directed named officers to:
 
 
 "1.</sentence>

<sentence id="s164">The letter went on to state that Ms Lawrence's arrest was made because it was strongly suspected that she was involved in a narcotics matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The heroin was referred to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">And it was stated that she was arrested in accordance with Primary Art 82(1)(a) and Supplementary Art 78(1)(b) of Republic of Indonesia Law No 22 of 1997 on Narcotics ("the Narcotics Statute").</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Seemingly, like letters were sent to the consulate concerning the other applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">29 It would appear from Mr Watson's evidence that the INP completed its investigation into the applicants on 15 August and on that day delivered the Dossier of evidence to the office of the Prosecutor for consideration of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">On 27 September 2005 the Prosecutor delivered the Dossier to the Denpasar District Court for consideration by the judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Beginning with Scott Rush on 13 October 2005, the applicants were brought before the Court and each was charged upon the Court's reading of the charges against him or her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">30 It is an agreed fact for the purposes of this application that no request has been made by the Indonesian Government to the Australian Government or by the Australian Government to the Indonesian Government in relation to any investigation, arrest or prosecution of the persons now known as the Bali nine under the provisions of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">31 After referring below to statutory and other materials relevant to this case which do or are said to govern the conduct of the AFP in this matter, I will refer to what are agreed facts as to Australian Federal Police practice in relation to police to police cooperation particularly in matters which could expose a person to the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">RELEVANT STATUTES, TREATIES, INSTRUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Statutes 
 (i) The Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 (Cth) 
 
32 This Act provides the backdrop to the causes of action that might be relied upon in any prospective proceeding to be brought by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">This Act abolished capital punishment in respect of offences under the laws of the Commonwealth and the Territories and, within the limits of Commonwealth legislative power, under Imperial Acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">(ii) The Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth) 
 
33 The significance of this Act to the applicants' case only became apparent in their supplementary written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">For present purposes I would emphasise the following features of this legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">First, it constituted the Australian Federal Police: s 6; and defined its functions and powers: ss 8 and 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Amongst its functions are the provision of police services in relation to laws of the Commonwealth and the safeguarding of Commonwealth interests: s 8(1)(b)(i) and (iii); and to do anything incidental or conducive to the performance of these functions: s 8(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The Act created the position of Commissioner of Police: s 6 and s 17; it conferred on the Commissioner, subject to the Act, the general administration of, and the control of the operations of, the AFP: s 37(1); it empowered the Commissioner to issue orders, in writing, in the exercise of his or her s 37 powers and AFP employees were obliged to comply with such orders, as they were with any lawful direction given by (inter alia) the Commissioner: ss 38, 39 and 40.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">34 The Minister administering this Act was likewise empowered to give written directions to the Commissioner with respect to the general policy to be pursued in relation to the performance of the functions of the AFP: s 37(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The Commissioner was obliged to comply with such directions: s 37(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">On 31 August 2004 such a direction was given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">It indicated that one of the expectations the Government had of the AFP was:
 
 "to be active in pursuing opportunities for cooperation and strategic alliances with ... international partners in law enforcement, to support effective action against multi-jurisdictional crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">" 
 

The AFP was to give "special emphasis" to (inter alia):
 
 
 " preventing, countering and investigating transnational and multi-jurisdictional crime, illicit drug trafficking ... 
 
 meeting Commonwealth interests in a safe and secure Australia by actively fostering relationships with other law enforcement agencies ... within Australia and overseas, where the provision and exchange of information is consistent with AFP functions ..." 
 
 

35 The AFP Act and the Australian Federal Police Regulations made under it apply both throughout and also "outside Australia": the AFP Act , s 5A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Finally, in abolishing the "independent discretion" rule exemplified in Enever v The King [1906] HCA 3 ; (1906) 3 CLR 969, s 64B provided (insofar as presently relevant) that: 
 
 
 "(1) The Commonwealth is liable in respect of a tort committed by a member in the performance or purported performance of his or her duties as such a member in like manner as a person is liable in respect of a tort committed by his or her employee in the course of his or her employment, and shall, in respect of such a tort, be treated for all purposes as a joint tortfeasor with the member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">" 
 
 
 
 (iii) The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (Cth) ("the Mutual Assistance Act") and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Republic of Indonesia) Regulations 1999 ("the Regulations") 

36 This Act assumed its presently relevant form as a result of amendments made to it in 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The 1996 legislation aimed (to quote the "Outline" to the Explanatory Memorandum to the 1996 Bill) to:
 
 
 " clarify the areas in which mutual assistance in criminal matters may only be sought by the Attorney-General and the areas in which assistance may be sought using other channels 
 
 enable the Attorney-General to grant or request assistance without the Act having to be applied by regulation to a particular country 
 
 give the Attorney-General a discretion to refuse assistance where the request relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person for an offence in respect of which the death penalty could be imposed or carried out 
 
 enable the Attorney-General to refuse assistance where he considers it appropriate in the circumstances of a particular request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">" 
 
 

37 The areas in which a request was required to be made by the Attorney-General, or to the Attorney-General in respect of a request by a foreign country, for international assistance in a criminal matter, were specified in the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Put shortly, they related to matters that would require either Australia (in respect of a foreign request) or the foreign country (in respect of an Australian request) to exercise coercive powers: see ss 5, 7, 10 and 11 and Parts II to VIIA of the Act; see also Second Reading Speech, Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, House of Representatives, Wed 26 June 1996, 2831-2832.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">38 Though the applicants initially placed considerable reliance upon the Mutual Assistance Act at the hearing, it is clear that (a) no request for assistance was made by the Governments of either Australia or Indonesia under this Act in this matter and (b) the assistance sought and given was not "of a kind that may be provided or obtained under this Act": s 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The applicants in consequence cannot rely directly on the Act in their search for a possible cause of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">39 It is also clear that the Mutual Assistance Act was not intended to prevent the provision or obtaining of international assistance in criminal matters other than assistance of a kind specified in the Act: s 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Nonetheless, the Act within its scope does address the giving of assistance at a foreign country's request in death penalty contexts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">40 The 1996 amending Act referred to above inserted the following paragraphs into s 8 of the principal Act:
 
 
 "(1A) A request by a foreign country for assistance under this Act must be refused if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with, or convicted of, an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed in the foreign country, unless the Attorney-General is of the opinion, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, that the assistance requested should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">
 
 (1B) A request by a foreign country for assistance under this Act may be refused if the Attorney-General: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) believes that the provision of the assistance may result in the death penalty being imposed on a person; and 
 
 (b) after taking into consideration the interests of international criminal co-operation, is of the opinion that in the circumstances of the case the request should not be granted :" emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">
 
 

41 In consequence of the provisions of s 7 and of the Regulations, the Act applied subject to the limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications as were necessary to give effect to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Treaty with Indonesia ("the Mutual Assistance Treaty"): the Mutual Assistance Act, s 7(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">42 The Regulations applied the Act to Indonesia "subject to the Mutual Assistance Treaty": reg 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">That Treaty was done at Jakarta on 27 October 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">A copy of the English text was a schedule to the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">43 Article 2 of the Treaty echoed the terms of s 6 of the Act in providing:
 
 "This Treaty shall not derogate from obligations subsisting between the Contracting Parties whether pursuant to other treaties or arrangements or otherwise nor prevent the Contracting Parties providing assistance to each other pursuant to other treaties or arrangements or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">" 
 

44 To anticipate matters, the actions taken by AFP officers in this matter in providing information to the Indonesian Police was pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and Indonesia entitled "Memorandum of Understanding Between the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the Government of Australia on Combating Transnational Crime and Developing Police Cooperation ("Police Cooperation MoU").</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">The Commissioner has indicated that this MoU would not be produced on this application first, because it is information of the type the application is designed to elicit if an order for information discovery was made and secondly, because its disclosure would be resisted on grounds of public interest privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">45 The Mutual Assistance Treaty also contemplated (in Art 4.2(d)) that assistance might be refused if the request related to "the prosecution or punishment of a person for an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed or carried out".</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">46 Amongst the criminal matters in which the Treaty contemplated assistance could be granted was "an offence against the law relating to dangerous drugs or narcotics".</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Treaties and Agreements 
 
47 Reference has been made above to Australia's Mutual Assistance Treaty with Indonesia and to its undisclosed MoU with Indonesia which, apparently, provided the basis for the actions of the AFP officers in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">48 The applicants also rely in this application upon Australia's ratification both of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 13 November 1980 ("the ICCPR") and, more importantly for present purposes, of the Second Optional Protocol to that Covenant on 2 October 1990 ("the Protocol"), it coming into force on 11 July 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Under the Protocol, Australia agreed that no one within its jurisdiction would be executed: Art 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Under the Covenant, Australia agreed (inter alia) that "Every human being has the inherent right to life": Art 6.1; see also Art 3, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Guidelines 
 
49 Under reg 4 of the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations 1979 an AFP member is obliged to have regard to any official guidelines that apply to the performance of his or her duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">In their original submissions and at the hearing considerable reliance was placed by the applicants on the "AFP Practical Guide on International Police to Police Assistance in Death Penalty Charge Situations" ("the Death Penalty Charge Guide").</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">It is now acknowledged in the applicants' supplementary submissions that this Guide is not directly relevant in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">50 Nonetheless, the terms of the Death Penalty Charge Guide warrant quotation:
 
 "The Attorney-General in consultation with the Minister for Justice has determined that in future Australia will exercise a discretion when considering foreign requests for mutual assistance in criminal matters where the request relates to a charge attracting the death penalty under the law of the requesting country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">In the exercise of that discretion, assistance may be refused in the absence of an assurance from the requesting country that the death penalty would not be imposed or carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The Attorney-General has decided that this policy will also apply to police to police requests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">
 
 Consistent with the Attorney-General's decision, in future the following will apply in relation to AFP cooperation with overseas law enforcement agencies: 
 
 
 
 &#8226; police to police cooperation may continue on the present basis i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">the AFP may provide such assistance as requested, provided it meets existing policy guidelines, irrespective of whether the investigation may later result in charges being laid which may attract the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">
 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; where the assistance of the AFP is sought by the police or another law enforcement agency of a foreign country in relation to a matter in which a charge has been laid under the law of that foreign country, for a crime attracting the death penalty, no action is to be taken, nor should any indication be given as to the decision likely to be taken in respect of the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">All such requests are to be notified to the Director International and Operations as soon as possible after receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Following consultation with the Attorney-General's Department, the General Manager National Operations will provide the Commissioner and Deputy with such advice as considered necessary in order that advice may be provided to the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General:" emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Indonesian Laws 
 
51 Articles 82(1)(a) and 78(1)(b) of the Indonesia Narcotics Statute as I have called it, provide respectively that:
 
 "Art 82(1) Whosoever without a right and illegally: 
 
 
 (a) imports, exports, offers for sale, traffics, sells, purchases, offers up, accepts, or acts as an intermediary in the sale, purchase or exchange of a Category 1 narcotic is to be punished by the death sentence or life imprisonment, of not more than 20 (twenty) years imprisonment and a fine of not more than Rp 1,000,000,000.00 (one billion rupiah); 
 
 Art 78(1) Whosoever without a right and illegally: 
 
 ... 
 
 b. possesses, stores for their own possession or for supply, or is in control of a Category 1 narcotic not in plant form, is to be sentenced to not more than 10 (ten) years jail and fined a maximum of Rp 500,000,000.00 (five hundred million rupiah).</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">" 
 

52 I understand it to be the case that each of the applicants have been charged under both of these provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Australian Federal Police Practice 
 
53 The following are agreed facts as to AFP practice: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The Death Penalty Charge Guide replicates government policy in relation to how the AFP goes about investigating offences that may attract the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">It clearly sets out what information the AFP will pass over to foreign law enforcement agencies, the stages it will do so and what the AFP will not pass to foreign law enforcement agencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The Guide does not apply where the assistance requested is in relation to a person who has not been charged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Once the person has been charged then under the Guide, the AFP requires the authorisation of the Attorney-General and/or the Minister for Justice and Customs to be able to hand over that information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Any police assistance given prior to the laying of the charge ceases after the person has been charged and does not continue unless the necessary authorisation is given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">In relation to the Bali 9 case, the Guide did not apply to the assistance provided because no charges had been laid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The Guide does refer to arrangements for police-to-police cooperation where the suspect has not been charged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">In such cases the AFP would continue to supply information as required, provided it meets existing policy guidelines, irrespective of whether the investigation may later result in charges being laid which may attract the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Police to police information may be provided pursuant to an MoU with the requesting country or an existing treaty between Australia and the requesting country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">In the absence of an MoU or a treaty the AFP may still provide assistance at its discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The AFP relies generally on the provisions of the AFP Act as a basis for providing the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The Guide applies in relation to common law countries as well as civil law countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">In relation to civil law countries where a charge is usually laid only after a dossier is prepared, evidence is gathered and a case is made, the AFP will cooperate up to the point a charge is laid irrespective of whether the dossier is being prepared for a likely charge which will eventuate in the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Any information handed over to foreign law enforcement agencies is recorded on the AFP internal systems and there is a very strict audit trail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Not all requests for assistance prior to a suspect being charged can be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">For example, where assistance requires coercive powers to be exercised here in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Such requests would need to fall under the Mutual Assistance Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The Guide is the only internal policy guideline which applies in relation to international police-to-police assistance in death penalty charge situations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">The Attorney-General and Minister for Justice and Customs are not aware or notified as a matter of course, of the documents that the AFP provides to a foreign law enforcement agency prior to a charge being made involving the death penalty unless the Attorney-General requests a briefing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The decision to provide assistance is an operational decision for the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Briefings of the Minister are not normally done prior to the AFP making an operational decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">
 THE APPLICANTS' CASES 
 
54 The identity discovery sought by all of the applicants, is that of the member or members of the AFP who made the operational decisions to request assistance from the INP regarding the applicants and who provided assistance to the INP concerning the applicants' activities in Bali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">That additionally sought by Scott Rush is the identity of the member or members of the AFP who made the operational decisions (a) not to inform him prior to his departure from Australia that he was under surveillance and being monitored by the AFP and (b) not to advise his parents or Mr Myers of the decision not so to inform him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">55 In their written submission, the applicants point to communications with an officer of the Australian Government Solicitor ("the AGS") in which inquiries as to the identity of the relevant persons were made but note that as a result of those inquiries and of the affidavits filed by the respondent, they are still unable to identify the members of the AFP, other than Mr Hunniford, who have been involved in making decisions or taking actions that have exposed the applicants to the risk of the death penalty in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">56 The information discovery sought is of documents of the AFP which relate to operational and other decisions which led to the arrest and detention of the applicants on 17/18 April 2005 in Bali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The written submissions indicate non-exhaustive categories of such documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">They refer also to the same correspondence with the AGS noted above and claim that the information so acquired from the Commissioner is insufficient to enable the applicants to make a decision whether to commence a proceeding in the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">In particular the submissions point to the insufficiency of the information in relation to ascertaining whether there is a valid legal basis for the apparent decision or course of action which exposed the applicants to the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">57 I have already indicated that the manner in which the applicants cast their possible causes of action has changed significantly subsequent to the hearing, as is evident from their supplementary written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Notwithstanding these changes to which I will refer below, their possible causes of action fall under three rubrics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">The first two can be described as involving applications for declaratory and possibly other relief against AFP officers (yet to be identified), they having (i) acted without lawful authority in making decisions and taking actions which exposed the applicants to the death penalty in Indonesia; or (ii) failed to satisfy the applicants' substantive legitimate expectations as Australian citizens that the Australian Government and its agencies and public officers would not act in such a way as to expose them to the risk of the imposition of the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The third rubric is that of tort law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">First, it is asserted that Lee Rush's provision of information to the AFP concerning the possible activities of his son gave rise to a relationship creating a duty on members of the AFP not to use that information in a way that would expose at least Scott Rush to the foreseeable risk of the death penalty in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Further, in the circumstances surrounding the provision of the information to the AFP, the AFP assumed responsibility for Scott Rush.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">The possible tort claim in this is said to be in negligence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Distinctly, it is asserted that there is potentially a claim for misfeasance in public office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">58 I will consider each of these three possibilities in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">CONSIDERATION 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Acting without lawful authority 
 
59 As it was initially put, the applicants' case as I understand it would be to the effect that the requests made to the INP for assistance in the two Hunniford letters of 8 and 12 April 2005 ought to have been made, if at all, under the Mutual Assistance Act in which case they would have to have been made by the Attorney-General.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The requests in consequence were made unlawfully.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">60 To the extent that this contention was premised on the proposition that the requests made were for assistance of a kind that could be obtained under the Mutual Assistance Act it is demonstrably untenable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">The Hunniford requests were not for the exercise in Indonesia of any of the coercive powers specified in that Act and for that reason they could not be requests for assistance under the Act: cf s 10(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">I need not repeat here what I have earlier said in relation to the limited scope of the Mutual Assistance Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">61 To avoid this conclusion the applicants now seek to construe the Act in such a way that any request for international assistance in a criminal matter, whether or not of a kind that may be made under the Act, must be made by the Attorney-General.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Section 10(2) is relied upon to that end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">This is not what the sub-section says.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Section 10(1) prescribes that the Attorney-General alone must make any request for assistance of a kind that Australia is authorised to make under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Subsection (2) of the same section, though, makes plain that subsection (1) does not prevent the Attorney-General on behalf of Australia from requesting assistance beyond what can be obtained under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">What the subsection does not say is that the Attorney-General is to be the exclusive channel for such other requests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">It is permissive not prescriptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">62 Other provisions both of the Mutual Assistance Act and of the Mutual Assistance Treaty with Indonesia make plain that no such limitation on the making of other requests was so intended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Section 6 of the Act expressly states that the Act does not prevent the provision etc of international assistance in criminal matters other than assistance of a kind that may be provided under that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Section 5 (the objects provision) states the purpose of the Act to be (inter alia) to facilitate the obtaining by Australia of international assistance in criminal matters: s 5(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">The interpretation of s 10(2) proposed by the applicants impedes rather than advances that purpose especially in light of s 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Distinctly, the Mutual Assistance Treaty (the provisions of which limit the applicability of the Mutual Assistance Act to requests between Australia and Indonesia: see s 7(3)(a)) expressly provides that the Treaty does not derogate from obligations subsisting between the contracting parties, nor does it prevent them from providing assistance to each other: Art 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Finally, if Parliament had intended through s 10(2) to impose such a fetter on obtaining international assistance in criminal matters as the applicants submit, thereby precluding the taking of such action as would otherwise be mandated by other legislation (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">the AFP Act : see below), one would have expected it to have spoken with far greater clarity than it has, the moreso given the purpose of the Act noted above: see Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (1996) 137 ALR 47 at 63-64.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">63 I am in consequence satisfied that, on the proper construction of the Mutual Assistance Act, any foreshadowed cause of action founded on that Act must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">In the circumstances it provides the applicants with no basis for any reasonable cause to believe they may have a right to obtain relief in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">64 In supplementary submissions, the focus of the applicants' prospective ultra vires case turned to the provisions of the AFP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">The relevant provisions of this Act and of directions given under it are set out at [33] to [35] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">It is now contended that the functions and powers set out in ss 8 and 9 of that Act, when read in context, do not include, authorise or justify any act or decision made by an AFP member which exposes an Australian citizen to the death penalty, whether in Australia or overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">The context referred to in this submission is said to be provided by the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 ("the Abolition Act "), the provisions of s 8(1A) and (1B) of the Mutual Assistance Act, unambiguous Australian Government policy which is opposed to the death penalty (at least for its citizens) and Australia's signing of the Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">65 What this proposed claim would ask for would be a significant reading down of what on its face is the unambiguous meaning of s 8 of the AFP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">As the 8 and 12 April letters make plain, the provision of information by members of the AFP to the INP related to a suspected importation of heroin contrary to the "laws of the Commonwealth".</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">In consequence it fell squarely within the lawful functions of the AFP: s 8(1)(b) and s 8(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">It was, moreover, an activity within the scope of what was envisaged in the ministerial direction made under s 37(2) of the AFP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">It involved cooperation with the INP "to support effective action against multi-jurisdictional crime"; it related to "illicit drug trafficking"; and it reflected the active fostering of a relationship with the INP involving "the provision and exchange of information ... consistent with AFP functions": Ministerial direction of 31 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Nonetheless, it is said that context requires this reading down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">66 It is now well accepted that the modern approach to statutory interpretation requires that "context" be considered at the first instance, not merely at some later stage when ambiguity might be thought to arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">"Context" here is used in a wide sense and includes legal and historical context: see CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2 ; (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408; Braverus Maritime Inc v Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd [2005] FCAFC 256 at [36] ; see also Allsop, "Statutes: Context, Meaning and Preenactment History", Jo of NSW Bar Assoc, Winter 2005, 19 ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">It is questionable whether any of the matters relied upon are relevantly contextual for the purposes of interpreting s 8 of the AFP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">67 The international treaties and instrument that have been ratified by Australia and on which the applicants rely have not as such been incorporated into Australian law by express enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">The Abolition Act pre-dated Australia's signing up to the Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Neither the Abolition Act nor the Protocol addresses action taken by Australian public officers or agencies vis-&agrave;-vis foreign law enforcement agencies in connection with offences in their jurisdiction which can there attract the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Neither expressly or impliedly prohibits taking such action as, for example, the provision of information of the type contained in the Hunniford letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Neither expressly betrays an intent in relation to such action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">The Abolition Act cannot thus properly be used to read down s 8 of the AFP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">The Second Optional Protocol only came into effect for Australian purposes years after the enactment of s 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">It provides no contextual aid to the section's interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">In any event it imposes no obligation on a Contracting Party vis-&agrave;-vis a non-contracting party in respect of the former's dealings with the latter in relation to offences in the latter jurisdiction which can attract the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Even if s 8 was relevantly ambiguous, the Second Optional Protocol could not assist in resolving that ambiguity: see Dietrich v R [1992] HCA 57 ; (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 306; Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade v Magno (1992) 37 FCR 298 at 303-304.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">68 The Mutual Assistance Act (which again post-dates the AFP Act ) neither provides context for the construction of the AFP Act nor reveals any intent to amend s 8 so to effect a reading down of the AFP's functions as suggested by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">In the circumscribed discretions reserved to the Attorney-General to provide assistance in death penalty cases, ss 8(1A) and (1B) expressly acknowledge there is no absolute prohibition of the type propounded by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">69 Moreover, when one has regard to the Death Penalty Charge Guide (see [50] above) with which AFP officers must comply, it is contemplated that police to police cooperation, as here, is to occur on the basis that the AFP may provide the assistance requested irrespective of whether the investigation to which it relates may later result in charges being laid which may attract the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">70 It may be possible to discern in Australian legislation, treaties, official guides, etc a declared antipathy to the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">That antipathy, though, has not been pursued unqualifiedly in our legislation and guides in relation to dealings with foreign countries in respect of matters which could attract the imposition of the death penalty: cf the Mutual Assistance Act ss 8(1A) and (1B) and the Extradition Act 1998 (Cth) s 22(3)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">It is unsurprising that it has not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">In particular contexts, the call of other public interests may be the more powerful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">As was said in Rodriguez v United States 480 US 522 (1987) at 526: "Deciding what competing values will or will not be sacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative choice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">71 I do not consider that the applicants have made out any reasonable cause to believe they have an arguable case for the reading down of s 8 of the AFP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">I should add for the sake of completeness that it may be the case that, even if the AFP Act were to be read down as contended for, it would not prevent members of the AFP from making the request they did in the absence of legislative authority: cf Barton v The Commonwealth [1974] HCA 20 ; (1974) 131 CLR 477 at 490.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">It is unnecessary to express any view on this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">72 A distinct way in which the applicants had proposed challenging the propriety of the AFP members' conduct in making the two requests was to contend that that conduct did not comply with the requirements of the Death Penalty Charge Guide such that, arguably, those members committed disciplinary offences under reg 4 of the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations 1979.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">It was not made at all apparent how, even if such disciplinary offences could have been made out, this would have availed the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">73 As I understand the applicants' supplementary submissions they no longer rely upon breach of the Guide and Discipline Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">However, I should make the following comments in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">First, and subject to what I later say, the Guide, on its face, may well be only of indirect relevance in this matter in that its substantive content is directed to how AFP members are required to act in relation to requests for assistance made of it by a foreign country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">It is silent on requests made by the AFP of an overseas law enforcement agency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Secondly even if the standards prescribed in the Guide (with appropriate adaptation) be taken as the operative ones when a request is made by the AFP --- and I consider this was probably their intendment --- the conduct of the officers concerned in this case (whoever they may have been beyond Mr Hunniford) could not properly be said to have been relevantly in breach of the Guide as it related to "police to police" cooperation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">The requests made and the information provided pre-dated the INP investigations and the arrests and detention of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">In consequence it pre-dated any "charges being laid which may attract the death penalty" irrespective of how the term "charges" should be interpreted in the Guide as it applied to the formalities of the Indonesian legal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Finally there was, as I have indicated, authority for the AFP members to make their request under the AFP Act and that in turn was translated into a practical arrangement with Indonesia in the Police Cooperation MoU under which, according to Mr Watson, the actual requests were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">The MoU is not in evidence before me for the reasons I earlier gave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Nonetheless, counsel for the applicant was provided with the opportunity to inspect the MoU or to have the Court inspect it, but declined to take either course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Counsel for the Commissioner has nonetheless indicated to the Court that the terms of the MoU contemplated the very provision of information by the AFP in circumstances such as in this matter and it could properly be said of the MoU that there was a standing request by Indonesia for such assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">In the above circumstances, I am prepared to accept (a) that the applicants cannot claim reasonably to believe that the information provided to Indonesia was totally unsolicited and (b) that, possibly, the AFP in providing the information was acting upon a general request by Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">However, for the reasons I gave above, I do not consider it to be of any consequence whether the request was made by the AFP or by Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">The AFP members acted in conformity with the Death Penalty Charge Guide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">74 Despite their various and varying formulations of a potential cause of action based on what compendiously I have called acting without lawful authority, I am not satisfied that the applicants have been able to identify or articulate any reasonable cause to believe that they are or may be entitled to obtain relief in this Court under this rubric.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">Not satisfying the applicants' substantive legitimate expectations 
 
75 The potential cause of action advanced here is not one it is open to me to entertain as Australian authority now stands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">The invitation held out to me is to embrace the law on "substantive legitimate expectation" as adumbrated in decisions of the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong in Ng Siu Tung v Director of Immigration (2002) 5 HKCFA 1 and of the House of Lords in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department; ex parte Zeqiri [2002] UKHL 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">The impediments to my so doing are substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">As Sir Anthony Mason recently observed: "It would require a revolution in Australian judicial thinking to bring about an adoption of the English approach to substantive protection of legitimate expectations": (2005) 12 Aust Jo of Admin Law 103 at 108.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">76 The applicants initially sought to contend that they had in Australian law an enforceable right to life and not to be executed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">The ICCPR and the Second Optional Protocol were invoked to this end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">This was later abandoned, as it had to be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">The provisions of an international treaty do not form part of Australian law merely because Australia is a ratifying party to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">For that reason neither the ICCPR nor the Second Optional Protocol of itself "operate[s] to give rights to or impose duties on members of the Australian community: Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 85 ; (1999) 84 FCR 438 at [35] ; see also Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57 ; (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 305-306.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">77 Scott Rush sought as well to allege a denial of procedural fairness in that he was not advised prior to his departure from Australia that he was under surveillance and being monitored, after assurances were allegedly given by a member or members of the AFP to Scott Rush's parents (via Mr Myers) that he would be so advised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">78 The alleged expectation of procedural fairness that was said to have so arisen resulted from (on the evidence in Scott Rush's case) communications made directly or indirectly to his father and not to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">It was not suggested that Scott Rush had any awareness of those communications or that he ordered his conduct in consequence of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">This prospective cause of action had no prospects of success at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">79 Even if (a) an obligation of procedural fairness could arise in the setting of present concern (see below) and (b) the alleged duty to be advised could properly be described as being procedural and not substantive in character: see Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 22; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 ("Teoh") at 291; the particular expectation in question, arising as it allegedly did, was not one entertained by Scott Rush: see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam ; [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 ("Lam") at [36], [90]-[93], [95] and [145].</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">In consequence, Scott Rush would have been unable to show practical injustice done to himself: Lam , at [36].</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">As I understand it, from the applicants' supplementary written submissions, no reliance is now being placed by Scott Rush on a possible claim so framed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">80 It is now the applicants' position that each of them, in their capacity as Australian citizens, has a substantive legitimate expectation that the Australian Government, its agencies and public officers will not act in such a way as to expose them to the risk of the imposition of the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">The supplementary written submissions, though, do not go on to indicate how, in this matter, this expectation provides a reasonable cause to believe that the applicants may have a right to relief in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">81 For present purposes all I need note of the "doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation" is what was said of it in the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong in Ng Siu Tung v Director of Immigration at [92]:
 
 "The doctrine recognizes that, in the absence of any overriding reason of law or policy excluding its operation, situations may arise in which persons may have a legitimate expectation of a substantive outcome or benefit, in which event failing to honour the expectation may, in particular circumstances, result in such unfairness to individuals as to amount to an abuse of power justifying intervention by the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Generally speaking, a legitimate expectation arises as a result of a promise, representation, practice or policy made, adopted or announced by or on behalf of government or a public authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">" 
 

This in turn drew upon the reasons of Lord Woolf MR (for the court) in R v North and East Devon Health Authority; Ex parte Coughlan [2001] QB 213; see also Craig, Administrative Law, 639-656 (5 th ed 2003); Sedley, "The last 10 years' development of English public law", (2004) 12 Aust Jo of Admin Law 9 at 18-20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">82 In light of the decisions of the High Court in Teoh and in Lam it is clear that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is for the present not part of Australian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">For present purposes I need only refer to the joint judgment of McHugh and Gummow JJ in Lam at [66]-[67]:
 
 "The doctrine of 'legitimate expectation' has been developed in England so as to extend to an expectation that the benefit in question will be provided or, if already conferred, will not be withdrawn or that a threatened disadvantage or disability will not be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">This gives the doctrine a substantive, as distinct from procedural, operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">
 
 
 
 
 
 The earlier English decisions with respect to 'legitimate expectations' were discussed by Mason CJ in Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin and by McHugh J in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh .</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">In Quin , Mason CJ observed: 
 
 
 
 'In the cases in this Court in which a legitimate expectation has been held entitled to protection, protection has taken the form of procedural protection, by insisting that the decision-maker apply the rules of natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">In none of the cases was the individual held to be entitled to substantive protection in the form of an order requiring the decision-maker to exercise his or her discretion in a particular way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">The prevailing view in this Court has been, as Stephen J observed in Salemi [v MacKellar [No 2] ], that: '[t]he rules of natural justice are "in a broad sense a procedural matter"", echoing the words of Dixon CJ and Webb J in Commissioner of Police v Tanos .</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 That remains the position in this Court and nothing in this judgment should be taken as encouragement to disturb it by adoption of recent developments in English law with respect to substantive benefits or outcomes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">" 
 
 

83 For the purposes of O 15A rr 3 and 6 the applicants are thus unable to show that a claim for relief based on the "doctrine" so relied upon could lead to relief being granted in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Tort 
 
84 Two potential tort claims have been suggested in support of the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">In Scott Rush's case a possible claim in negligence is foreshadowed; and in the cases of all of the applicants, claims for misfeasance in public office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">(i) Negligence 
 
85 Scott Rush's potential negligence claim has been propounded in the following way in the supplementary written submissions: 
 
 
 "17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">On the facts in this case, the relevant question to be asked is this: did the provision of information by Mr Lee Rush concerning the possible activities of his son (the First Applicant) to a member or members of the AFP, give rise to a relationship creating a duty on members of the AFP not to use that information in a way that would expose the First Applicant and/or others to the (foreseeable) risk of the death penalty in Indonesia?</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">
 
 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">[T] his case is concerned with the reasonable expectation on the part of Mr Lee Rush and, by implication, the First Applicant, that information provided by Mr Rush would not be used by the AFP in a way that would expose the First Applicant to the risk of the death penalty, and with positive acts done by a member or members of the AFP which did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">
 
 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">It is submitted that, in the circumstances surrounding the provision of information to the AFP concerning the possible activities of the First Applicant, the AFP impliedly undertook not to use, or act upon, the information in such a manner as to put the First Applicant at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia, and so, at least to that extent, assumed responsibility for the First Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">" 
 
 

86 What is immediately apparent in the above is that it attempts neither to locate the alleged duty to Scott Rush in the context of an ongoing AFP investigation nor to justify the imposition of the duty in such a context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Rather, it addresses the question whether the circumstances of Lee Rush's providing information to the AFP founded a reasonable expectation in Lee Rush that the AFP would not use, and an implied undertaking (though to whom is not stated) not to use, that information in a particular way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">While that inquiry may be a step in the fashioning of an action for breach of confidence by Lee Rush, or a possible duty of care to Lee Rush (if, hypothetically, the unauthorised disclosure of the information would expose Mr Rush to a reasonably foreseeable risk: cf Swinney v Chief Constable of Northumbria Police [1997] QB 464), it does not lead necessarily or obviously to potential relief for Scott Rush in a negligence action by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">At best it hints at Lee Rush's having put the AFP in a position of power over Scott Rush, a position which carried with it an obligation not to exercise that power adversely to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">What I should emphasise as well is that whatever claims, if any, Lee Rush might be able to mount against an officer or officers of the AFP in consequence of their dealings --- and I do not suggest that the present circumstances suggest he might have any such claims --- he is not a party to this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">87 I referred above to the absence of reference to the context in which the duty allegedly owed Scott Rush is said to arise for this reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">In Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35 ; (2002) 211 CLR 317 ("Tame") at [231] Gummow and Kirby JJ observed in dicta:
 
 "It is unlikely that an investigating police officer owes a duty of care to a person whose conduct is under investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Such a duty would appear to be inconsistent with the police officer's duty, ultimately based in the statutory framework and anterior common law by which the relevant police service is established and maintained, fully to investigate the conduct in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">" 
 

Their Honours cited in support of this view the decisions (inter alia) of Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police [1987] UKHL 12 ; [1989] AC 53 ("Hill") at 63-65 and Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59 ; (2001) 207 CLR 562 at [60] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Similar views were expressed in Tame by McHugh J at [125]-[126]; Hayne J at [298] and by Callinan J at [335]-[336].</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">88 Understandably, the respondent's submissions focus (a) on the impossibility of there being such an obligation in this matter given its incompatibility with the actual investigation being conducted by the AFP at the time; (b) on the alleged false premise of the supposed obligation given that the AFP had, on Mr Watson's evidence, derived the relevant information connecting Scott Rush with the eight other members of the group from an extant AFP investigation; and (c) on Scott Rush being the author of his own harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">89 Before I express my own views on this, I should emphasise the following.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Bearing in mind that this is an application for preliminary discovery where information about the possible commission of a tort is being sought, exceptional caution must be exercised before reaching a conclusion that, whatever the information that might be disclosed as a result of an order for information discovery, that information could make no difference for the reason that the duty contended for could not even arguably be imposed on AFP members when conducting the drug trafficking investigation in question: cf the observations of Lord Bingham in Brooks v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2005] UKHL 24 ; [2005] 1 WLR 1495 at [4] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">90 As noted earlier, there are conflicting versions as to the substance of the conversations between Robert Myers (on behalf of Lee Rush) and Mr Patching of the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">The alleged duty of care is premised upon acceptance of Myers' version of what transpired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">For present purposes, and dealing with the matter on the basis most favourable to the applicants, I am prepared to assume the correctness of that version for the purposes of this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Nonetheless, I am satisfied from what is already known about the circumstances surrounding Myers' communications with Patching, that the negligence claim as it has been framed would in any event be unarguable irrespective of any further information relevant to it that might conceivably be forthcoming if an order for information discovery were to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Accordingly, I am satisfied for the purposes of O 15A r 3 that no such proceeding for negligence could properly be brought in this Court and, for the purposes of O 15A r 6, there is no reasonable cause to believe that Scott Rush may have a right to obtain relief on the basis proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">91 It is widely accepted in common law jurisdictions that, at common law, police officers owe to the general public a duty to enforce the criminal law and, correspondingly, that latitude necessarily must be given to those responsible for the conduct of police operations in the judgments required to be made to that end: see generally Hinchcliffe v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2001] FCA 1747 ; (2001) 118 FCR 308 at [33] - [35] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">As Lord Denning observed in R v Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall; Ex parte Central Electricity Generating Board [1982] 1 QB 458 at 472: "It is of the first importance that the police should decide on their own responsibility what action should be taken in any particular situation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">92 It equally is well recognised that to impose common law duties of care on police officers to a particular member or members of the public in addition to their duty to the general public can, on occasion, be "inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of [their public] responsibilities": cf Sullivan v Moody , at [62]; (whether those responsibilities arise under a statute such as the AFP Act or at common law) and to be impermissible for that reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">As the observations of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Tame illustrate, this inconsistency is often revealed where, in a setting in which injury is foreseeable if care is not taken in the conduct of a police investigation, a suspect, a victim, or a third party injured by acts or omissions of the police seeks to raise a claim in negligence against the police: Hill , above; Thompson v Vincent [2005] NSWCA 219 at [152] - [154] ; Batchelor v State of Tasmania [2005] TASSC 11 ; Cran v State of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 92 ; (2004) 62 NSWLR 95; see also D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 214 ALR 92 at [101] ; State of New South Wales v Paige [2002] NSWCA 235 ; (2002) 60 NSWLR 371 at [115] - [117] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">Save in exceptional circumstances: cf Hill at 62; Batchelor , above; and in North America see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Doe v Board of Commissioners for Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (1990) 72 DLR 4 th 580 ("Doe"); Eaton, "Liability of Municipality or Other Governmental Unit for Failure to Provide Police Protection from Crime" 90 ALR 5 th 273 at SS4 ; 57 Am Jur 2d, "Municipal, County, School and State Tort Liability", SSSS407-418; such attempts have been unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">93 Primary concerns manifest in English and, in some degree, Australian case law have been to maintain the effectiveness of particular police functions (and notably the conduct of investigations and the suppression of crime) and to avert their compromise or undermining by the imposition of a duty to an individual (or individuals) over and above that owed to the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">In English law this has led to the adoption of an exclusionary principle (or immunity) which is often cast in broad terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">So, for example, in Calveley v Chief Constable of Merseyside Police [1989] 1 AC 1228 it was said by Lord Bridge (at 1238) that:
 
 "... it would plainly be contrary to public policy ... to prejudice the fearless and efficient discharge by police officers of their vitally important public duty of investigating crime by requiring them to act under the shadow of a potential action for damages for negligence by the suspect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">" 
 

94 The progenitor of this principle was the decision of the House of Lords in Hill .</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">After concluding that, in the circumstances of that case, the ordinary principles of negligence would not admit of a duty of care to a victim of crime, Lord Keith went on to indicate (at 63) that there was "another reason" why an action for damages in negligence should not be against the police in the circumstances of that case and that was "public policy".</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">His Lordship then observed:
 
 "The general sense of public duty which motivates police forces is unlikely to be appreciably reinforced by the imposition of such liability so far as concerns their function in the investigation and suppression of crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">From time to time they make mistakes in the exercise of that function, but it is not to be doubted that they apply their best endeavours to the performance of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">In some instances the imposition of liability may lead to the exercise of a function being carried on in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">The possibility of this happening in relation to the investigative operations of the police cannot be excluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Further it would be reasonable to expect that if potential liability were to be imposed it would be not uncommon for actions to be raised against police forces on the ground that they had failed to catch some criminal as soon as they might have done, with the result that he went on to commit further crimes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">While some such actions might involve allegations of a simple and straightforward type of failure --- for example that a police officer negligently tripped and fell while pursuing a burglar --- others would be likely to enter deeply into the general nature of a police investigation, as indeed the present action would seek to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">The manner of conduct of such an investigation must necessarily involve a variety of decisions to be made on matters of policy and discretion, for example as to which particular line of inquiry is most advantageously to be pursued and what is the most advantageous way to deploy the available resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">Many such decisions would not be regarded by the courts as appropriate to be called in question, yet elaborate investigation of the facts might be necessary to ascertain whether or not this was so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">A great deal of police time, trouble and expense might be expected to have to be put into the preparation of the defence to the action and the attendance of witnesses at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">The result would be a significant diversion of police manpower and attention from their most important function, that of the suppression of crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Closed investigations would require to be reopened and retraversed, not with the object of bringing any criminal to justice but to ascertain whether or not they had been competently conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">I therefore consider that Glidewell LJ, in his judgment in the Court of Appeal [1988] QB 60, 76 in the present case, was right to take the view that the police were immune from an action of this kind on grounds similar to those which in Rondel v Worsley [1967] UKHL 5 ; [1969] 1 AC 191 were held to render a barrister immune from actions for negligence in his conduct of proceedings in court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">" 
 

 95 Hill's case, I would note, has been referred to approvingly in some number of High Court judgments: see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Sullivan v Moody at [57]; Tame at [231], [335]; see also Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]; Cran v State of New South Wales , at [33] ff; but cf contra Zalewski v Turcarolo [1995] 2 VR 562 a decision which pre-dated Sullivan v Moody .</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">96 I will return below to whether such an exclusionary principle based on public policy accurately reflects the law in this country; see Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]; or whether the "principle" does no more than represent the usual or predictable, but not invariable, consequence of the evaluation of whether the relationship between the police and an individual in a given instance imports a duty of care in the context of a police investigation: cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan [2002] HCA 54 ; (2002) 211 CLR 540 at [149] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Before so doing, it is important to emphasise that police officers are not as such and in all circumstances immune from the law of negligence for acts or omissions in the course of official duty that occasion foreseeable harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">The contrary is clearly the case, as a large case law in common law jurisdictions, including England, attests: Zalewski v Turcarolo ; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police [1999] 1 All ER 550; see also Grubb (ed), The Law of Tort , "The Police" 16.73 ff (2002); Linden, Canadian Tort Law , 286, 625 (7 th ed 2001); Todd (ed), The Law of Torts in New Zealand , 204, 212 ff (3 rd ed, 2001); Eaton, above 90 ALR 5 th 273.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">97 By way of illustration I would note that a duty of care has been assumed, or found to exist:
 
 (i) in the conduct of a high speed police motor vehicle pursuit of a suspected criminal ( Schilling v Lenton (1988) 47 SASR 88; see also Marshall v Osmond [1983] 1 QB 1034; 57 Am Jur 2d, above SS439); 
 (ii) where a superior officer failed to go to the assistance of another officer whom he knew was being attacked close by and for whom he had a responsibility ( Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police , above; Mullaney v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police [2001] EWCA Civ 700) ; 
 (iii) in positively provoking or acting in disregard of a real and substantial risk of harm to a person ( Zalewski v Turcarolo , above) or property ( Rigby v Chief Constable of Northamptonshire [1985] 1 WLR 1242); 
 (iv) in providing for the safety and well-being of persons in police custody ( Hall v Whatmore [1961] VR 225; Howard v Jarvis [1958] HCA 19 ; (1958) 98 CLR 177; Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1999] UKHL 35 ; [2000] 1 AC 360); 
 (v) in relation to preserving the confidentiality of information provided by an informant identifying a criminal suspect, the disclosure of which was likely to expose the informant and her husband to a greater risk of harm at the hands of the suspect than the ordinary risk to the general public ( Swinney v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police );
 (vi) in Canada, to protect a woman who was unaware she was knowingly being used by police as "bait" to catch a serial rapist in circumstances in which the police deliberately failed to warn of the risk she faced for fear of compromising their investigation though knowing that the rapist would attack again and cause irreparable harm to his victim ( Doe v Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) Commissioners of Police (1998) 160 DLR 4 th 697); and
 (vii) in a United States jurisdiction, in delaying in responding to calls made by assault victims, the assurance that help was on its way having been given to them ( Chambers-Castanes v King County 669 P2d 451 (1983); and see Zitter, "Liability for Failure of Police Response to Emergency Call" , 39 ALR 4 th 691).</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">

98 What is noticeable in the case law of common law countries illustrated above (including that of England) is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that, particularly in cases of omissions to act, the police may nonetheless have, or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a "special relationship" with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her: see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">Brooks v Commissioner of Police at [22] and [29]; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police esp per May LJ; in US jurisdictions the "special relationship" exception is well recognised in a range of otherwise negligence exempt areas of police activity, see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">Eaton, above at SS4 ; see also 57 Am Jur 2d, above, at SS410 ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">What equally is notable is the varying significance given to the particular "operational" context in which the relationship giving rise to a duty of care is said to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Hence the ready imposition of a duty of care to persons in police custody: Hall v Whatmore , above; and the corresponding reluctance to impose such a duty in the context of the conduct of a criminal investigation D'Orta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at [101]-[102]; see also Cran v State of New South Wales , above; or in preventing a breach of the peace: Thompson v Vincent , above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">99 Australian case law, while generally conforming in its results with particularly comparable English decisions, has not unreservedly committed itself to the public policy immunity prevailing in England.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">The Court of Appeal of New South Wales on a number of occasions --- and most recently in Cran v State of New South Wales --- has adopted an approach to cases involving investigative conduct that reflects the immunity principle found in English decisions and particularly Hill's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">In Cran v State of New South Wales it was noted by Santow JA that in Tame's case, "there are strong dicta suggesting that the English authorities would be followed in Australia" (at [35]) and that "on present authority [in New South Wales] the greater public interest accorded unimpeded investigation by the police ... preclude[d] any duty of care to the appellant" (at [63]) in that case where a prisoner claimed damages for post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from unnecessarily prolonged imprisonment because of delay in a police investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">100 In contrast, the 1995 decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria and the recent Tasmanian decision of Batchelor v State of Tasmania are more questioning of whether the immunity principle (at least in the scope given it) is part of Australian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">101 It is, in my view, unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether, as in England, a special though not unqualified, immunity rule applies to police activities "in the investigation and suppression of crime": Costello's case at 563; or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and, if relevant, common law functions: see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan .</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">However, I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating "reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire ... has been thought to lay down" on the immunity of police: cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police , at [3], [6] and [28]; and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity: see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">Costello ; Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary [2001] EWCA Civ 1699 ; tell in favour of avoiding any special rule applicable to police, while still acknowledging that the police function can have distinctive characteristics and purposes which in many settings may exclude the concurrent operation of a duty of care at common law: cf Doe , 72 DLR 4 th at 584-586.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">102 Sullivan v Moody did not involve an allegation of negligence against police officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">Its concern was with whether medical practitioners and social workers who had examined children for evidence of sexual abuse by their fathers in the setting of a statutory regime containing provisions for the protection of children (including mandatory reporting to a government department of reasonable suspicion of child abuse), owed a duty of care to protect such fathers in the conduct of their examinations, investigations and reporting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">It was held unanimously by the High Court that they did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">The plaintiff fathers had alleged that, as a result of negligent examination, diagnosis and reporting, they had suffered shock, distress, psychiatric injury and consequential personal and financial loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">Unsurprisingly, given the opinions expressed by the Court, Sullivan v Moody has been influential in this country in later decisions and judicial commentary on police liability for negligence in the conduct of investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">103 In rejecting the duty of care argued for in Sullivan v Moody the Court observed:
 
 
 "55.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">... A duty of the kind alleged should not be found if that duty would not be compatible with other duties which the respondents owed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">
 
 56.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">How may a duty of the kind for which the appellants contend rationally be related to the functions, powers and responsibilities of the various persons and authorities who are alleged to owe that duty?</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">A similar problem has arisen in other cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">The response to the problem in those cases, although not determinative, is instructive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">
 
 57.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">In Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire , the House of Lords held that police officers did not owe a duty to individual members of the public who might suffer injury through their careless failure to apprehend a dangerous criminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Lord Keith of Kinkel pointed out that the conduct of a police investigation involves a variety of decisions on matters of policy and discretion, including decisions as to priorities in the deployment of resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">To subject those decisions to a common law duty of care, and to the kind of judicial scrutiny involved in an action in tort, was inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">
 
 ... 
 
 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The circumstance that a defendant owes a duty of care to a third party, or is subject to statutory obligations which constrain the manner in which powers or discretions may be exercised, does not of itself rule out the possibility that a duty of care is owed to a plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">People may be subject to a number of duties, at least provided they are not irreconcilable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">A medical practitioner who examines, and reports upon the condition of, an individual, might owe a duty of care to more than one person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">But if a suggested duty of care would give rise to inconsistent obligations, that would ordinarily be a reason for denying that the duty exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Similarly, when public authorities, or their officers, are charged with the responsibility of conducting investigations, or exercising powers, in the public interest, or in the interests of a specified class of persons, the law would not ordinarily subject them to a duty to have regard to the interests of another class of persons where that would impose upon them conflicting claims or obligations .</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">
 
 ... 
 
 62.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">The statutory scheme that formed the background to the activities of the present respondents was, relevantly, a scheme for the protection of children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">It required the respondents to treat the interests of the children as paramount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Their professional or statutory responsibilities involved investigating and reporting upon, allegations that the children had suffered, and were under threat of, serious harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">It would be inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of those responsibilities that they should be subjected to a legal duty, breach of which would sound in damages, to take care to protect persons who were suspected of being the sources of that harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">The duty for which the appellants contend cannot be reconciled satisfactorily, either with the nature of the functions being exercised by the respondents, or with their statutory obligation to treat the interests of the children as paramount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">As to the former, the functions of examination, and reporting, require, for their effective discharge, an investigation into the facts without apprehension as to possible adverse consequences for people in the position of the appellants or legal liability to such persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">As to the latter, the interests of the children, and those suspected of causing their harm, are diverse, and irreconcilable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">That they are irreconcilable is evident when regard is had to the case in which examination of a child alleged to be a victim of abuse does not allow the examiner to form a definite opinion about whether the child has been abused, only a suspicion that it may have happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">The interests of the child, in such a case, would favour reporting that the suspicion of abuse has not been dispelled; the interests of a person suspected of the abuse would be to the opposite effect:" emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">
 

104 As I earlier noted, the judgment of Gummow and Kirby JJ in Tame relied on Sullivan at [60] above when expressing the view that it was unlikely that an investigating police officer would owe a duty of care to a person whose conduct was under investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame .</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">In its apparent endorsement of Hill at [57] in the above quotation, Sullivan along with Hill and D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid above, have been treated by the New South Wales Court of Appeal as recognising that there is "an area in which it has been held that the public law duties of police are not consonant with recognition of a private law duty of care in favour of a particular member of the public": Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154].</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Again, as I have already noted, Tame and its debt to Sullivan and Hill were relied upon again by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Cran v State of New South Wales in privileging the greater public interested accorded unimpeded police investigation over the interest of a person suffering foreseeable harm as a result of an allegedly careless omission in the conduct of an investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">105 In light of the above cases, and putting to one side the effect if any of the communications between Mr Myer and Mr Patching, there would be no arguable basis at all for any contention that AFP officers had a legal responsibility to warn any of the applicants either that they were under police surveillance or that they were exposing themselves to the foreseeable risk of the death penalty especially given the information acquired about the applicants in the ongoing AFP investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">Having been prepared for whatever reason to engage in criminal activity, the applicants would properly be regarded as the authors of their own harm: cf Emanuele v Hedley [1998] FCA 709 esp in its reliance on State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold (1991) 25 NSWLR 500 at 517.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">And the police would have been entitled to have treated them as no more than subjects of an ongoing criminal investigation which fell clearly within the mandated functions of the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Given the police's function in the matter, the applicants would not have been objects of rescue (as they would have been if there was a duty to warn).</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">106 Did the Myer-Patching communications, as I am assuming them to be, give such a different complexion to the relationship of AFP officers with Scott Rush and/or with the other applicants as to establish an arguable case that a duty such as is proposed by the applicants was owed to him or to them?</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">In my view they did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">107 First, it needs to be emphasised that the AFP was performing a statutorily mandated function, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">the provision of legal services in relation to laws of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">The particular subject of the inquiry --- transnational crime and illicit drug trafficking - fell within areas of "special emphasis" in the direction given to the Commissioner by the Minister on 31 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">As the 8 April 2004 letter to the INP reveals, the AFP was already possessed of a considerable body of information relating to past and likely prospective moves of (inter alia) the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">That letter indicated the AFP's purpose in making its request was that "[t]he AFP would like to identify the source of the drugs and the organisers (other than CHAN) in Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">In other words there was a rational and proper police purpose for the making of the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">If there was to be a concurrent common law duty of care, this was the statutory and operational setting with which it had to be compatible: cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan at [147].</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">108 Secondly, there was no contact between the AFP and any of the applicants at all let alone contact that could lead Scott Rush or any of the others to reasonably believe or expect that the AFP had assumed some tutelary responsibility for him or her on which each could rely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">109 The Myer-Patching communications were directed to Lee Rush, not to the applicants generally or to Scott Rush in particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">I assume for the purposes of this application, that those communications led Lee Rush reasonably to believe that AFP officers would and did speak to Scott Rush at Sydney airport and because of this he did not go to Bali to save his son from committing any offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">I equally assume that Scott Rush was to have been the beneficiary of the police action Lee Rush believed had occurred and that the police failure to speak to him before his departure to Bali denied him the opportunity to abandon his participation in the trafficking operation given its predictable consequence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">However, it is not the failure to warn as such that underpins the alleged negligence of the AFP officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">Rather it appears to be said that, having regard (a) to the alleged provision of information by or on behalf of Lee Rush to Patching about the apprehended criminal activity by Scott Rush, and (b) the request for assistance in relation to Scott Rush's departure from Sydney and the alleged representation that it had been given, the AFP's failure to act against this background may have authored a duty not to use the information in a way that put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Hence it is said there is reasonable cause to believe that he may have a right to obtain relief from the relevant AFP officers in a negligence action in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">110 It is unnecessary to enlarge here on the question whether this Court would have jurisdiction in any event to entertain such a suit in negligence in the Northern Territory against members of the AFP as Commonwealth officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">I simply adhere to the affirmative view I expressed on a similar question arising in the Australian Capital Territory in O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1180 ; (2000) 101 FCR 160.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">My reasoning in that case is "equally applicable to the Northern Territory": ALRC Report 92, The Judicial Power of the Commonwealth, 652 (2001).</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">111 The proposed negligence claim could well be described as a mutated form of breach of confidence action with the important difference that the duty said to be owed by the AFP officers was not owed to the supplier of the information, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">Lee Rush, but to the subject of it, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">Scott Rush.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Furthermore the limitation on the use of that information proposed by the applicants is a narrow one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">It is not that the AFP could not use the information supplied at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Rather it could not be used in a way that would put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">112 It need hardly be said that the disclosures of information about Scott Rush made by or on behalf of Lee Rush to AFP officers could not give rise to a duty of confidence to Lee Rush such as would prevent its use by the AFP in its investigations into drug trafficking into Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">The disclosures related to apprehended serious criminal misconduct: cf Corrs Pavey Whiting &amp; Byrne v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434 esp at 456.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">And a court would not enforce any contractual or equitable obligation relating to such information, the effect of which would have been to obstruct the administration of the criminal law: A v Hayden [1984] HCA 67 ; (1984) 156 CLR 532.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">113 Recasting the matter in terms of a duty of care owed to Scott Rush does not advance the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">While it is said that the AFP had assumed a responsibility for Scott Rush in the circumstances surrounding the Myer/Lee Rush provision of information to AFP officers, the basis for such an assumption of responsibility has not been explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">Neither has any possible justification been advanced for there being a concurrent duty of care to Scott Rush alongside the public law duties of the AFP officers concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">114 There is a short answer to the alleged duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">Even if it be the case that AFP officers said they would act, or had acted, in a particular way towards Scott Rush at the airport and failed to do so, neither their representations and their failure to act nor the circumstances of the Myer-Patching conversations could give rise to a duty such as is alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">The proposed duty would be inconsistent with the duty owed by the AFP to the public at large in the conduct of its investigations into the Bali drug trafficking operation: cf Sullivan v Moody at [60].</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">115 I have already indicated that the AFP officers concerned did not act in contravention of the AFP Act in deciding to, and in making, the 8 and 12 April 2005 communications to the INP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">They were acting in performance of their functions under the AFP Act and consonantly with ministerial directions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">The communications made had a proper and rational purpose in the furtherance of that police investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">The proposed duty would only qualify and impede the conduct of the investigation embarked upon by the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">It would elevate the interests of Scott Rush over the public interest that the AFP was serving under its legislation to the extent that the two collided, as it did in the making of the request to the INP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">116 If, as the other applicants seem to suggest albeit faintly, a like duty was owed them its obvious effect would have been to compromise the investigation itself in an important respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">No assistance of the type sought could have been asked of the INP notwithstanding that the investigation involved transnational criminal activity and that the assistance in fact sought, as I have noted, was for a proper purpose in furtherance of the AFP's statutory functions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">117 In the cases of Scott Rush and of the other applicants the duty contended for cannot be reconciled with the nature and purpose of the functions being exercised by the AFP officers concerned, the discretions conferred on them in virtue of the task they were involved in, and the policy directive they were, apparently, implementing: cf Sullivan v Moody at [62].</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">Accordingly, to adopt Santow JA's observations in Cran v State of New South Wales at [63], the greater public interest accorded unimpeded investigation by the AFP precludes in this case any duty of care owed to Scott Rush or to the other applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">Such is the current law in this country and the policy informing it, that the interests of the applicants were subordinated to the public interests served by the AFP in their conduct of the investigation in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">118 I should add for the sake of completeness that I do not consider that it would make any difference to this conclusion if it was the case that the AFP officers concerned had knowingly misled Lee Rush for the purposes of securing the Bali investigation from potential compromise (given its purpose as revealed in the 8 April 2001 request) and the stage reached in the AFP's own investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">Whatever the moral wrong to a caring parent that may have been involved in so doing, it could not have authored a duty of care such as has been proposed in this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">119 No order for either identity discovery or information discovery will be made in relation to the intended cause of action based on the alleged possible negligence of AFP officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">That proceeding would have no prosects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">(ii) Misfeasance in Public Office 
 
120 The applicants contend that the facts of this case as presently known to them raise, as a potential cause of action, the tort of misfeasance in public office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">For the purposes of the elements of the tort, it is said that:
 
 (i) the actions and decisions causing harm to the applicants were done by public officers (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">Mr Hunniford and others unknown); 
 (ii) the actions and decisions involved the purported exercise of powers as a public official; and
 (iii) the actions and decisions were done with reckless indifference to the possible lack of powers or invalidity and to the likely injury to the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">

121 It is unnecessary for present purposes to discuss the elements of this tort in any detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">They were recently essayed by the Full Court of this Court in Sanders v Snell (No 2) [2003] FCAFC 150 ; (2003) 130 FCR 149.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">I would note, though, that the tort can take two forms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">In one form (that of "targeted malice") it must be shown that the public officer in question has acted as such with an actual intent to cause injury to a person or persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">In its alternate form it must be shown either that the officer has actual knowledge both that his or her action was beyond power and would cause or be likely to cause injury or else that the officer has acted with reckless indifference both to the possibility his or her action was beyond power and to the possibility that that action would cause or be likely to cause injury: see generally Sanders v Snell (No 2) at [95]-[100].</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">122 The applicants' contentions in relation to this tort require that close attention be given to the requirements of O 15A r 6 in particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">I emphasise this for this reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">123 The essence of the misfeasance tort in either of its forms is the "dishonest abuse of power": L (a child) v Reading Borough Council [2001] EWCA Civ 346 ; [2001] 1 WLR 1575 at 1588.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">I am in complete agreement with the submissions of the respondent that there is no basis at all in the material before me to suggest any reasonable cause to believe that Mr Hunniford or other AFP officers acted with the reckless indifference asserted in the applicants' supplementary written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">What is being advanced is at best "a mere possibility".</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">The evidence does not "incline the mind" towards assenting to the proposition asserted: cf St George Bank Pty Ltd v Rabo at [26].</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">124 I have already indicated that the actions of the AFP officers concerned with the decisions and actions which led to the applicants' arrest were not of themselves ultra vires.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">There is no reasonable cause to believe that the decisions or actions were invalid because they were improperly motivated or that the officers were recklessly indifferent to the possible lack of power or validity in making those decisions or actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">Rather, on the evidence, they were referable to the Police Cooperation MoU with Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">And while it was a foreseeable and likely consequence of the 8 and 12 April letters to the INP, that the applicants would be arrested in Indonesia and in that sense be exposed to harm in the sense of being put at risk of the death penalty, there is again no material at all which could objectively incline me to the proposition that the likelihood of that harm was other than a possible consequence of what was in the circumstances a valid exercise of official power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">125 Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the applicants have met the limiting conditions of O 15A r 6(a) for the purposes of information discovery in respect of the potential tort of misfeasance in public office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">Equally I am not satisfied for the purposes of O 15A r 3 identity discovery that the prospective proceedings intended to be commenced would be other than speculative: Hooper v Kirella , at [33].</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">Hence this form of discovery will not be ordered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">CONCLUSION 
 
126 I will order that the application be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty-six (126) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn.</sentence>

<sentence id="s0">
 
1 This is an application for interlocutory relief in the form of a mandatory injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">It arises in the following circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The applicant has filed an application containing a claim pursuant to ss 52 , 75B , 80 , 82 and 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act') and for breach of contract relating to the purchase by the applicant from the first respondent (of which the second and third respondents were the sole directors) of the business of a child care centre in Karrinyup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The price of $276 153 was paid for goodwill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The claim is for an order for transfer of the telephone number of the business to the applicant and damages for failure to transfer the telephone number at settlement and for loss of goodwill from solicitation pre and post settlement and for failing to deliver financial records relating to the accounts of past and current customers of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The claim for interlocutory relief relates to the first principal claim, namely an order to occasion the telephone number of the business to be transferred to the applicant at no cost to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">This therefore is an application for interlocutory relief which, at least to the extent of the first claim in the application, would be decisive of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 The circumstances asserted in the statement of claim are as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The child care business purchased by the applicant is conducted at 21 Norman Street, Karrinyup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The business at that address was formally known as Tommie Turtle Karrinyup Child Care Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 The statement of claim asserts that around March 2005, the applicant received a written sales brochure ('the Brochure') for the sale of the child care business from a business broker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Brochure represented that the child care business had a weekly turnover of $7250, was strong and profitable in trading and had the potential to expand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Around 21 April 2005 the applicant and another company of which the second and third respondents were the only directors --- Patson Enterprises Pty Ltd, then mistakenly thought to be the company which owned the child care business --- entered into a written contract for sale of the business as a going concern ('the Original Contract').</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Paragraphs nine to twelve of the statement of claim plead as follows:

<sentence id="s23">7 Around that date the applicant was unable to arrange the transfer of the telephone number of the business into the name of the applicant because it had been transferred by or on behalf of the first respondent to the Karrinyup Child Care Centre at 22 Davenport Street, Karrinyup being the other centre in Karrinyup associated with the second and third respondents.</sentence>

Clause 32 provided that the agreement would be subject to the laws of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">12 In her first affidavit, Ms Skinner deposes that there have been persistent refusals by the respondents to transfer the telephone number to the applicant with the result that she arranged an alternative telephone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Her evidence was that in the short term this caused concern among the parents and until she changed her advertising she was in fact advertising the telephone number of a competing Karrinyup Child Care Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Additionally she had prepared signage prior to the settlement date which advertised the new trading name but contained the telephone number, being the number in dispute, namely 9224 1905.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">When the respondents refused to transfer the telephone number she incurred expense in changing the signage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">13 In her first affidavit, Ms Skinner also deposes that the telephone number in question is the subject of a listing in the Yellow Pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In the 2005 Yellow Pages the number appeared as part of listings for Tommie Turtle Child Care Centres in Belmont, Karrinyup and Huntingdale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It appeared as relating to the premises in Norman Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In the 2006 Yellow Pages it appeared as one of two numbers relating to the competing Karrinyup centre in Davenport Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Her evidence was that any telephone enquiries to the number in question were being received by the competing business associated with the second and third respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">This is in the context where the applicant has paid a substantial sum for the goodwill of the business at the Norman Street premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">14 In her second affidavit, Ms Skinner deposes that an internet online search of the Yellow Pages for child care centres in Karrinyup shows the telephone number 9244 1905 as associated with the business at Norman Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In fact that number would be answered by the competing business of the respondents at 22 Davenport Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In contrast the 2006 Yellow Pages advertisement shows, as has been said, the two telephone numbers including the number in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Anyone using those references and phoning 9244 1905, would not have the availability of the current phone number of the Norman Street business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">15 Ms Skinner further deposes that on taking possession of the business and having been advised by Telstra that the business telephone number had been transferred to Karrinyup Child Care Centre, they tried to arrange transfer of the number from the vendor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In the meantime she arranged a substitute business telephone number for the Norman Street business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It was then too late to advertise in the Yellow Pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Her evidence is that the Norman Street business has the capacity to take further enrolments and that not having the telephone number previously associated with the business is critical to it, particularly at this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">She testifies that many parents are most active in seeking child care over the period from now until about mid to late February as this is the most active enrolment period for the forthcoming school year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">She further deposes that some prospective parents seeking child care would still use the 9244 1905 number in an effort to contact the Norman Street business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">This is because it is currently advertised in Yellow Pages online for that address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Also, there may be parents who wish to re-enrol students and who will have previous records of the address of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Additionally, she had distributed business cards prior to settlement on which the number in dispute had been advertised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">She further states that in her experience parents looking for child care centres view the Yellow Pages and focus on a suburb.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The consequence of the present modes of listing in the Yellow Pages is that the applicant has been deprived of telephone enquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">16 As to the steps taken by the applicant to obtain the telephone number, the evidence of Ms Skinner is that an email was sent on 29 August 2005 to the respondents' settlement agents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">A further complaint was lodged by letter dated 1 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Correspondence then continued between solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Following a letter of 25 October 2005 from the solicitors for the respondents to the solicitors for the applicant it became apparent that the possibility of a negotiated settlement and transfer of the telephone number in question was 'exhausted'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The applicant then had to consider the step of initiating proceedings which was not a step it took likely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">During November 2005 Ms Skinner and her husband 'mulled over the matter'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Ms Skinner had further discussions with the solicitors for the applicant and in early December 2005 gave instructions for an opinion to be sought with regard to the initiation of proceedings in relation to the purchase, for damages and for the transfer of the telephone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It was on 14 December 2005 that counsel was briefed and proceedings were filed on 23 December 2005 resulting in the interlocutory hearing on 13 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">17 The affidavit of Ms Dornford for the respondents is as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">She deposes that the billing address had been changed and the telephone number in issue transferred prior to settlement of the sale of the business at Norman Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">On the second occasion in which she had met Ms Skinner, Ms Skinner had confirmed that she did not wish to use the business name 'Tommie Turtle' and wished to trade under the name of 'Tiny Beez'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">18 On or about 25 July 2005, Ms Dornford received a letter together with her co-director addressed to the 'Tommie Turtle Child Care Centre' from Sensis Pty Ltd in respect of the Yellow Pages advertising program and inviting them to check the particulars of their advertising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">She deposed that as the representative of the applicant had advised there was no requirement for the 'Tommie Turtle' name she requested Sensis Pty Ltd to remove the Norman Street address from the 'Tommie Turtle' Yellow Pages advertisement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">This was at a time when all of the special conditions of the contract had not been satisfied and it was by no means certain that the applicant would proceed with the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The deadline for placing advertisements with the 2006 Yellow Pages was around 22 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">19 Approximately two weeks prior to settlement in a telephone conversation with Ms Skinner, Ms Dornford advised her that the first and second respondents would be taking the telephone number 9244 1905 to the premises of Karrinyup Child Care Centre at 22 Davenport Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Ms Skinner replied that could not be done because she had ordered signage and stationary bearing the name Tiny Beez with that telephone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Ms Dornford advised her that she had already arranged for the Yellow Pages advertising and it was too late to change it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Ms Skinner did not say anything more about it until after settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In particular, no request was made by or on behalf of the applicant for the transfer of the telephone number prior to settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">20 Prior to settlement, Ms Dornford diverted the line, 9244 1905, back to a second line at Norman Street until the date of settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">That second line was cancelled by her on 29 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The applicant wished to reconnect the second line and that occurred on 30 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">21 Ms Dornford's evidence is that she only became aware of the objection to the retention of the telephone number, 9244 1905, in the conversation referred to above that occurred two weeks prior to settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Even then the applicant had not requested the transfer of the telephone number to it and had proceeded to settlement knowing that the respondents intended to take the telephone number with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">22 So far as the applicant seeks to attribute reduction in turnover to the transfer of the telephone number in question to the respondents, Ms Dornford says that many of the actions and policies of the applicant could have contributed to the alleged loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">23 Her further evidence was that if the respondents are ordered to transfer the telephone number now, any customers referring to the 2006 Yellow Pages seeking to contact 'Tommie Turtle' will be put through to 'Tiny Beez'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">24 Mr Dornford's affidavit is generally supportive of the evidence of Ms Dornford.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">In addition he deposes that he has been told by advisors and it is his experience in business generally, that it is the responsibility of a purchaser (here the applicant) to make applications for the transfer of a business telephone number because Telstra could then make any necessary credit arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">No such application had been made to Telstra by the applicant prior to settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">WHETHER SERIOUS QUESTION TO BE TRIED 
 
25 The nub of the applicant's claim with respect to the transfer of the telephone number, 9244 1905, is that there is a breach of contract in it not having originally been transferred to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">This directs attention to the provisions in the sale agreement, the relevant portions having been set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">26 It is apparent that the applicant as purchaser waived the right to the transfer of the business name provided for in cl 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">27 The relevant provision with respect to the telephone number is that appearing in cl 4(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The question raised by the terms of the clause is whether in fact the telephone number in question was 'an asset of the Business'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Part A of the sale agreement describes the business as the goodwill of the child care centre business carried on at 21 Norman Street, Karrinyup under the name of Tommie Turtle Karrinyup Child Care Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">That latter name is identified as 'the Business Name'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">It is clear that the business name was not an asset to be transferred at settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">28 The prima face position raised by cl 4(a) is, in my opinion, that there is an obligation on the respondents as vendors to deliver to the applicant as purchaser the documents and certificates establishing or providing evidence of title and ownership to the asset comprised by the telephone number being the number associated with the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">29 The respondents state however that such cannot be the case where prior to settlement the applicant has been advised that the telephone number will not be transferred and has made no demur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The respondents have not contended that amounted to a waiver but it nevertheless relies on the evidence of non-response from Ms Skinner on behalf of the applicant to the advice that the telephone number was not included in the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">30 Further, there is some issue, not yet viewed with complete clarity, as to whether the respondents are disputing that any consideration passed for the telephone number in terms of the goodwill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Certainly the respondents contend that the mere reference to the amount of money paid for goodwill does not itself establish that the particular telephone number was included in the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">31 In my view there is a serious issue to be tried on the question of whether there was a breach of contract in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">On the face of it the contractual provisions give rise to a right, however, the full effect of the evidence on which the respondents rely cannot be determined until trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE 
 
32 The respondents contend that the applicant has not shown to the requisite standard that on the balance of convenience it should be granted an injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It relies on a number of factors which are generally finely balanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">33 First is the delay between the date of settlement and the application to the Court for interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The second affidavit of Ms Skinner makes apparent that the delay is not entirely explained by the time taken for exchange of correspondence between solicitors and others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Rather, there was at least a month when those involved in the applicant 'mulled over the matter'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The reality is that the business purchased by the applicant has been able to be contacted under the second line installed by the respondents prior to settlement and taken over after settlement by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Nevertheless, there is evidence that the business purchased by them is not yet fully enrolled and that this is an important time of the year for maximum access in terms of attracting enrolments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Further, the respondents make the point that as there never was any indication from them that they were willing to transfer the telephone number the delay in issuing proceedings for an injunction is not adequately explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Further, the respondents contend that the applicant has failed to show why the transfer of the telephone number after a period of almost five months would benefit it to a degree that would outweigh the hardship to the respondents given that it was Ms Skinner for the applicant who had advised she did not wish to use the 'Tommie Turtle' name and that number has been associated with the 'Tommie Turtle' name and now with the new premises by customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">34 Further, it is contended that the applicant has failed to show that the transfer of the telephone number would enhance the goodwill of the business to a significant degree compared to other advertising such as signs on site, newspaper advertising, electronic Yellow Pages or direct mail outs that would cause no hardship or inconvenience to the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">35 Further, it is contended for the respondents that if the Court takes the view that the applicant is entitled to the telephone number in question, transferring the telephone number after such a delay when a contrary advertisement has been placed at this stage is not the appropriate remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">36 Therefore, it is said that the applicant must prove on the balance of probabilities that not only is it entitled to the number pursuant to the sale agreement but that it has suffered at least some damage as a result of the transfer of the telephone number to new premises in circumstances where it is not sought to retain the former business name and that there is a benefit it would obtain if the telephone number was transferred back to it after a lapse of some months which would outweigh the hardship to the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The respondents submit that the applicant has not proved this to the required standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Therefore it is said this is a case where an injunction is not an appropriate remedy, and by implication damages could be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">37 For the applicant reliance is placed on the statement in RP Meagher, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity: Doctrines and Remedies 4 th edn Butterworths 2002 at 
[21-380] where it is stated:
 
 'The greater the hardship to the defendant, the greater the reluctance of the Court to grant the injunction; but, the more it is apparent that an equal or further hardship would be caused to the plaintiff by refusing an injunction, or the stronger a plaintiff's case appears, the more that reluctance will be dissipated: Beese v Woodhouse [1970] 1 All ER 769; [1971] WLR 586.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">' 

38 The applicant submits that the only stated concern of the respondents is that any customers referring to the printed 2006 Yellow Pages seeking to contact Tommie Turtle at Davenport Street will be put through to Tiny Beez being the Norman Street business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">However that is in circumstances where the online Yellow Pages displays the Norman Street address with the 9244 1905 telephone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">39 Additionally the Davenport Street business has an alternative telephone number displayed in the printed 2006 Yellow Pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">40 In contrast any customers referring to telephone records other than the printed 2006 Yellow Pages seeking to contact the child care business at Norman Street would get the competing business of the respondents at Davenport Street without an alternative telephone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">This could include people using the current Yellow Pages on-line, past customers using business cards and their own records of telephone numbers, persons using printed Yellow Pages from 2005 and earlier or old stationary, old notations and telephone numbers given on a referral basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">41 The applicant submits that given the strong merits of the case for breach of contract in favour of the applicant, the risk of any confusion generated by the deliberate act of the respondents in advertising the Norman Street telephone number should be borne by the respondents given the difficulty of the applicant in assessing damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Had the respondents retained the Norman Street address when they received the letter from Sensis Pty Ltd dated 25 July 2005, there would have been no confusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Therefore, any confusion has been created by the deliberate breach of contract of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">They, therefore, should bear the risk of any confusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">42 The applicant also contends that the conduct by the respondents in approving the printed 2006 Yellow Pages listing at that time was done in breach of cl 13 of the general conditions of the agreement for sale which provided that the vendor was to conduct the business as a going concern until settlement in order to maintain goodwill and profitability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Relevantly that portion of the agreement reads:
 
 ' 13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">CONDUCT BEFORE SETTLEMENT 
 
 
 
 The Vendor agrees to conduct the Business as a going concern at the Premises until Settlement and: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) to conduct the Business efficiently, in a proper and businesslike manner, to the best of the Vendor's skill and ability, in order to maintain goodwill and the profitability of the Business such conduct to include promotional and marketing activities normal for the current trading period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">In the event such promotional, marketing or advertising activity entails or requires forward planning, bookings for advertisement placements, brochures, catalogues and the like, then the Vendor will assist the Purchaser with such planning and the Vendor will be liable only for such portion of the costs that are relevant to the remainder of the Vendor's trading time in the Business; 
 
 
 
 
 ...' 
 

 43 Therefore the applicant submits that the other way to contrast the situation is if the printed Yellow Pages advertisement for 2006 had stayed the same as for 2005 as it did for the online Yellow Pages then anyone ringing the 9244 1905 telephone number would have known it was for the business at Norman Street and that it was still a child care centre business notwithstanding the ownership had changed and so had the business name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">44 I find these factors flowing from the submissions of both parties in relation to the balance of convenience fairly evenly balanced themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The thing that ultimately persuades me that the applicant should succeed is the submission relating to the strength of the case for contractual breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">If the respondents had any case to argue in terms of legal categories arising from the advice to the applicant that the telephone number was not being transferred and the progression of settlement in the face of that knowledge, they have not made them apparent at the stage of this interlocutory application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Consequently the prima facie position remains that the contract has been breached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The strength of that position is entitled to resonate in the balance of convenience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">I therefore do not agree with the respondents that this is a case where the balance of convenience should nevertheless be allowed to tip in the respondents favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">This is because ultimately if interlocutory relief were not granted and the matter was determined adversely to the respondents at trial, as it will appear to be likely on the issue of contractual breach so far as it can be judged at this stage, the case for not granting any relief would have then been considerably escalated because of the reasonably longer time lapse involved to enable the resolution of the dispute at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">45 For these reasons I consider that the balance of convenience does tip in favour of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Consequently the interlocutory relief should issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">I certify that the preceding forty-five (45) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Nicholson.</sentence>

 Introduction 
 
1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court on 9 March 2005 dismissing the appellant's challenge to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal's decision, handed down on 27 July 2004, affirmed the decision of a delegate of the respondent Minister to refuse to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Tribunal's decision involved a redetermination of the appellant's claims consequent to an order for redetermination made by the Federal Magistrates Court on 15 March 2004 (see SZAIX v Minister for Immigration [2004] FMCA 104).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Tribunal had first determined the matter against the appellant in a decision handed down on 4 April 2003 which was subsequently set aside on judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">A twice-raped, ethnic Chinese and Christian Indonesian woman 
 
2 The appellant claims to possess a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of race, religion and membership of a particular social group, said to be either Indonesian women or Chinese Christian women in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The Tribunal accepted that the appellant was raped on two separate occasions a few weeks before leaving Indonesia and arriving in Australia in July 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">At the time of the first sexual assault, the appellant's attacker told her not to inform the police of his actions lest he harm her again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The appellant's father and brother nevertheless complained to the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The appellant then moved to the home of her relatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">She claimed that she was stalked by her attacker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The second sexual assault was carried out by the same attacker and another man.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The appellant claimed that her rapists were Muslim men.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">She also claimed they were policemen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The appellant claimed her fear of persecution arose from the rapes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The appellant claimed to fear that she will be raped again should she return to Indonesia, either by the man who raped her on both occasions, or by Muslim men.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Leave to raise new grounds of appeal 
 
3 The appellant sought leave to raise grounds of appeal not argued in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">She did not press the ground argued in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">4 The amended notice of appeal in substance raises three new matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">These are: 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">That the Tribunal applied the wrong test, as follows:
 
(a) that the Tribunal misunderstood the test for assessing whether women in Indonesia were a particular social group and thereby failed to ask itself the right question when determining whether or not the appellant was owed protection obligations under section 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'); 
 
(b) that the Tribunal failed to consider whether there was a failure of effective State protection in respect of the appellant for a ground under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva, on 28 July 1951 (1954 ATS 5) ('the Convention') and therefore failed to consider an essential integer of her claim; and
 
(c) that the Tribunal misunderstood the test for assessing whether it was reasonable to expect the appellant to relocate to another part of Indonesia by failing to assess the practical realities of the appellant's relocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It thereby failed to ask itself the right questions when determining whether or not the appellant was owed protection obligations under section 36 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Further, or in the alternative to 1(c) above, that the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant considerations when assessing whether it was reasonable to expect the appellant to relocate to another part of Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">These relevant considerations were:
 
(a) the fact that in Indonesia the appellant was a single mother responsible for two children who would have no family support or protection if she moved away from Jakarta;
 
(b) the fact that the appellant had been raped twice;
 
(c) the fact that the incidence of rape of women and children in Indonesia generally is a serious problem; and
 
(d) the fact that in other parts of Indonesia prejudice against ethnic Chinese Indonesians may be stronger than in Jakarta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">This led to a failure by the Tribunal to ask itself the right questions when determining whether or not the appellant was owed protection obligations under s 36 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">That by reason of the matters set out above the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">5 In addition to the formal application to raise new grounds, other questions were debated at the hearing (for convenience I continue the numbering from the previous paragraph): 
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Did the Tribunal fail to take relevant considerations into account or misunderstand the evidence concerning the appellant's claim to possess a well-founded fear of persecution as an ethnic Chinese and Christian woman?</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Did the Tribunal misunderstand the correct test, or ask the wrong question, for determining whether reasonably effective State protection was available against the feared persecution?</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Did the Tribunal fail to apply the correct legal test, or fail to take relevant considerations into account, on the question of the availability of State protection, in relation to future protection by the police?</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 
 

6 The appellant was legally represented at the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court, but submitted in this Court that the new grounds were not raised there in circumstances where her solicitor's grasp of the legal complexities appeared to be less than fully adequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The appellant submitted, and the first respondent ('Minister') agreed, that where it is expedient and in the interests of justice to grant leave to raise new grounds on appeal, the Court should do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The appellant cited VUAX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] (' VUAX' ) (and the cases there cited) in support of her request for leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">7 However, the Minister submitted that it was open to the appellant's solicitor in the Federal Magistrates Court to consider whether to raise the grounds now sought to be argued, and that the solicitor did so consider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">An appeal should not become an inquiry into the quality of the legal advice received by a party at first instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The Minister directed the Court's attention to paragraphs [16]-[18] of the Full Court's decision in Iyer v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788 (' Iyer '), in which the Full Court canvassed relevant authorities on this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Of note is the discussion by R D Nicholson J in Jones v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 63 FCR 32 (' Jones '), where his Honour observed at 47:
 
 '...The effect of [the] authorities, as I view them, is that where the new grounds could possibly have been met by calling evidence at the hearing or may have resulted in the case of the respondent being differently conducted at the trial, leave will be refused (the first proposition).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">However, where all the facts have been established beyond controversy or where the point is one of construction or of law, then it is a question for the Court of Appeal whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice to entertain the point (the second proposition).</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">... 
 ... 
 The authorities...while stressing the importance of the public interest in ensuring the finality of litigation, do not view that interest as likely to be paramount where the new grounds are within the second proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Lord Watson in Connecticut [ Fire Insurance Co v Cavanaugh [1892] AC 473] at 480 said that in the case of the second proposition "it is not only competent but expedient in the interests of justice, to entertain the plea".</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The rule derives, at least in part, "from public policy considerations directed to ensuring the finality of litigation" and, so far as it does so derive, "the relevant consideration is that the case sought to be made on appeal is a new or different case from that which emerged at the trial": Banque Commerciale SA [(En liq) v Akhil Holdings Ltd [1990] HCA 11 ; (1990) 169 CLR 279] at 284.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">' 
 

8 The Minister submitted that on this issue the Court must have regard to the interest held by her, and through her, the Australian people, in the finality of the procedures put in place for the determination of entitlements to protection visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In addition, the Court should have regard to the protection of the 'structure and integrity of the appellate process' (see Iyer at [23]), to which it is relevant, though not determinative, that the appellant failed to comply with Court deadlines for providing reasons why the grounds were not raised below, and particulars of the arguments relied upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">9 The appellant argued that her request for leave is supported by these factors: the facts are not in dispute and there is no possible need to admit new evidence for the new grounds (as in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1) (' Coulton '); granting leave would not be an effective grant of a new trial (also as in Coulton ); and the new grounds raised were involved as parts of the appellant's claim before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">She referred to Jones , where, as here, there was an express disavowal of grounds by the relevant legal representative, but the Court nevertheless granted the appellant leave to raise new grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">10 At the hearing, counsel for the appellant relied on Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146, suggesting that it is authority for the principle that the requirements of case management are relevant considerations, but they cannot be used to prevent a party from arguing a ground that is fairly arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Further, counsel suggested that there is a level of disagreement in this Court regarding the approach to be taken to this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">In doing so, counsel referred to the judgment of Allsop J in Branir v Owston Nominees (No 2) [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at 440, in which his Honour expressly declined to comment on the approach taken by Branson and Katz JJ in H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2000) 63 ALD 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In that case, their Honours gave consideration to the merits of the new grounds to be raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">On this point, counsel also referred to the discussion in VUAX at [48] where, it appears, the Full Court accepted that the merits of the new grounds are to be given consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The appellant argued that a party should be permitted to raise an arguable case provided any prejudice to other parties could be compensated by costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In addition, the appellant referred to the judgment of R D Nicholson J in Jones , where his Honour stated (at 48) that whether or not the Immigration Review Tribunal had complied with its statutory duty 'raises a point of law in the interests of justice which supports and outweighs, in all the circumstances, the public interest in the finality of litigation in these particular circumstances'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Jenkinson J (with whom Carr J agreed) similarly stated (at 37) that the '[o]bservance of such [statutory] requirements by a tribunal administering important and publicly scrutinised immigration laws should be encouraged by this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">A determination whether...the Tribunal satisfied those requirements is in my opinion expedient and in the interests of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">'
 
11 In NAJT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 I gave my views as follows (at [162]-[166]), Conti J generally agreeing:
 
 'Quite apart from a power to receive new evidence, what is the position of an appellate court rehearing a matter as to questions of law available on the materials before the trial judge but not raised at first instance?</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">An appellant wishing to raise fresh legal questions cannot, in the first place, be in a worse position than one seeking to augment the evidence itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Secondly, a party victorious at first instance is, in any case, liable to be defeated by a change in the law occurring before the appeal is heard; that, indeed, is conventionally given as the main practical difference between a "strict" appeal and one by way of rehearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The result of a new legal point being successfully raised is no harder for the litigant thereby defeated than if the defeat follows from some legal point newly raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Thirdly, however, there is undoubtedly great, general value in considerations of finality of litigation acting as a brake on appellate intervention, thereby preserving the integrity of the trial as the normal arena for final disposition of that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">As a general statement of principle there is no conflict between what the Full Court approved in Branir and the approach in the cases next referred to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
 In my respectful view, the correct approach, and the one generally adopted in practice in this Court, is that succinctly expressed in VUAX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 (" VUAX ") by Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ (at [46] --- [48]): 
 
 
 
 
 "Leave to argue a ground of appeal not raised before the primary judge should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so: O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310; H v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs ; and Branir ... at [20]-[24] and [38].</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In Coulton ..., Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ observed, in their joint judgment, at 7 : 
 
 
 
 
 
 'It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 The practice of raising arguments for the first time before the Full Court has been particularly prevalent in appeals relating to migration matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below, but which clearly has merit, is advanced, and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Where, however, there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">" (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">) 
 
 
 
 
 To similar effect, in Iyer ... Heerey, Moore and Goldberg JJ said (at [22] --- [24]): 
 
 
 
 
 
 "... We recognise that there is a particular sensitivity in refugee cases where an adverse decision may have very serious consequences for an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Although it is in the interests of justice that decisions be made on the true merits of the case sought to be argued, the structure and integrity of the appellate process must also be taken into consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It is incumbent upon parties bringing applications to the Court to review decisions of tribunals such as the [Tribunal] to make it clear from the outset what are the substantive grounds of review relied upon .... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 However, in order to determine whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice that leave be given to argue new grounds it is necessary to give some consideration to the merits of the grounds raised .</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">That does not mean that an appellate court should enter upon a full consideration of the grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">To do so would make the requirement for leave meaningless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It is sufficient to determine whether the grounds sought to be raised have a reasonable prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">We also consider it appropriate to take into account whether the appellant had the benefit of legal representation at the hearing before the primary judge .</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">" (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">) 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 Thus, relevant questions include: 
 
 
 
 
 1) Do the new legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success?</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 
 2) Is there an acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below?</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 
 3) How much dislocation to the Court and efficient use of judicial sitting time is really involved?</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 
 
 
 4) What is at stake in the case for the appellant?</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 
 
 
 
 5) Will the resolution of the issues raised have any importance beyond the case at hand?</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">
 
 6) Is there any actual prejudice, not viewing the notion of prejudice narrowly, to the respondent?</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 
 
 
 7) If so, can it be justly and practicably cured?</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 
 
 
 
 8) If not, where, in all the circumstances, do the interests of justice lie?</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">' (Original emphasis).</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 
 
 
 

12 I proceed to examine the various attacks sought to be raised against the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Issue 4: Ethnic Chinese and Christian women in Indonesia as a particular social group 
 
13 The Tribunal accepted that the rapes suffered by the appellant constituted harm of a kind sufficiently serious so as to amount to persecution under s 91R(1)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The Tribunal further accepted that 'ethnic Chinese women' in Indonesia are a particular social group within the Convention's meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">14 However, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant was raped for reasons of her membership of that group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Nor was the Tribunal satisfied that the appellant's fear of future persecution was for this reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The Tribunal accepted that riots which took place in Indonesia in 1998 were marked by mass rape of ethnic Chinese women but found that the independent sources it consulted 'do not suggest' that the targeting of ethnic Chinese women persisted beyond the 1998 riots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It concluded that there was 'no evidence' to suggest that ethnic Chinese women are singled out for sexual assault.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The Tribunal found that the 'prevalent and indiscriminate nature of such [sexual] attacks suggests that these attacks are opportunistic crimes committed for individualistic reasons against women perceived to be suitable victims'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It found there 'was nothing in the [appellant's] evidence' to lead it to conclude that in committing the rapes, the appellant's attackers were 'essentially and significantly motivated by her membership of the particular social group of ethnic Chinese women'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">15 The Tribunal's findings on this question were as follows:
 
 'The [appellant] claims to be fearful of the man primarily responsible for her rape and sexual assault.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The Tribunal has already found that the [appellant] was not attacked for the reason of her religion, ethnicity or membership of a particular social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The [appellant's] evidence at the hearing regarding the reasons as to why her attacker would want to harm her now was unambiguous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">She stated that that the man wants to harm her because he was upset that her father had reported the matter to the police and he wants to take revenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">When she was asked again if the man wanted to harm her in retaliation for her father's complaint, she said yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In the Tribunal's view, the essential and significant reason for the harm feared by the [appellant] is personal, namely revenge or retaliation for her father's complaint to the police and not any Convention related reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The Tribunal finds that the harm feared by the [appellant] is not Convention related [sic].</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">' 
 

16 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal's reasoning demonstrates that it failed to understand both the nature of this part of her claim and the evidence relating to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Whilst the Tribunal had said there was 'no evidence' to suggest that ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia are singled out for sexual assault, it did accept there was a 'general vulnerability felt by the ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In light of this acceptance, the Tribunal was obliged to deal with the appellant's claim that ethnic Chinese are likely to be targets of violence, and the evidence in support of that claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">There was evidence that, although government administrations have been more benevolent towards ethnic Chinese since 1998, ethnic Chinese, and Christians, have been targets of violence since that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The appellant submitted that the Tribunal jurisdictionally erred by not making findings on that evidence (which included a suggestion that Chinese women frequently wore chastity belts, such was their fear of rape), and thereby not considering it relevant in reaching its conclusion on this part of her claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">17 In concluding that there was no evidence to support a finding that ethnic Chinese women were singled out for sexual assault, the Tribunal referred to evidence submitted by the appellant that according to a non-government organisation 'sexual violence, including rape, mostly against women and children, could take place anywhere and involve anyone regardless of walk of life, education or age'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The appellant submitted that this did not undermine her claim: evidence that many women in Indonesia are at risk of rape does not deny that ethnic Chinese women may possess a well-founded fear of rape on grounds of their being ethnic Chinese.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">18 In response, the Minister argued two things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">First, that the Court should not read literally the Tribunal's use of the phrase 'no evidence': reading the Tribunal's reasons reasonably beneficially, it is clear enough that the Tribunal meant that there was no evidence it found convincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Second, and perhaps more importantly, that the validity of the intended ground of the appellant's appeal is immaterial, given that the Tribunal concluded that the essential and significant reason for the future harm feared by the appellant was not related to a Convention reason but was personal: she fears that she will be harmed again by her attacker in revenge for her father's complaint to the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">19 In my opinion, given the Tribunal's factual findings the Minister's submissions must be upheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">In the first place, the Tribunal's finding as to the true nature of the appellant's fear was a free-standing and sufficient reason to reject her claim to refugee status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">(There is a qualification to this as to the claim that, at street level, no adequate State protection via the police is available to the appellant, the lack being attributable to Convention reasons, but this is dealt with below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">On that finding, the persecution she feared was not for a Convention reason --- the Tribunal member rejected the hypothesis that the appellant was attacked because she was Chinese.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">It follows that she could not have been attacked because she was a member of the social group, ethnic Chinese women, found by the Tribunal to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">20 Secondly, read as a whole, and beneficially, the Tribunal's reasons sufficiently indicate that by 'no evidence' the Tribunal meant 'no sufficient reason'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Such an assessment was legally within the Tribunal's province.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">21 Thirdly, it is now trite that the Tribunal was only required to refer to the evidence it found persuasive and not to explain its rejection of each other piece of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Issue 1(a): Women in Indonesia as a particular social group 
 
22 The appellant claimed that she was persecuted on the grounds of her membership of the particular social group of women in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The Tribunal found that women in Indonesia did not constitute a particular social group within the Convention's meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The appellant argued that the Tribunal misunderstood the legal test for a 'particular social group'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">23 The Tribunal found that whilst the evidence 'indicates that violence against women in Indonesia is pervasive and women face considerable discrimination in the work place' it also 'suggests Indonesian women are active participants in Indonesian society'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The Tribunal found that Indonesian women participate in education, the work force and politics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Based on a 'country report' from the State Department of the United States of America, the Tribunal stated that whilst the Indonesian Guidelines of State Policy and legal statutes adopted by the MPR (People's Consultative Assembly) state that women's participation in the development process must not conflict with their role in improving family welfare and the education of the younger generation, the Guidelines explicitly state that women have the same rights, obligations, and opportunities as men.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The Tribunal then concluded that women in Indonesia are not a particular social group within the meaning of the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Nowhere in the section of the Tribunal's decision headed 'Findings and Reasons' did the Tribunal expressly refer to the question of whether Indonesian women are cohesive or share interests, goals or aspirations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The Tribunal did however, in the course of recording the evidence later referred to by it in its 'Findings and Reasons' on the question of 'a particular social group', record that the appellant was invited at the hearing to comment on the assertion that Indonesian women did not share interests, goals or aspirations but did not so comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">24 In seeking to determine whether women in Indonesia are 'a particular social group', the Tribunal referred to Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225, and quoted the following passage from the judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ in Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387 (' Applicant S ') at [36]:
 
 '...First, the group must be identifiable by a characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Secondly, the characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group cannot be the shared fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Thirdly, the possession of that characteristic or attribute must distinguish the group from society at large.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Borrowing the language of Dawson J in Applicant A , a group that fulfils the first two propositions, but not the third, is merely a "social group" and not a "particular social group".</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">' (Footnotes omitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">)
 

The Tribunal then took the following approach to the question of whether 'a particular social group' exists: 'Whether a supposed group is a "particular social group" in a society will depend upon all of the evidence including relevant information regarding legal, social, cultural and religious norms in the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">'
 
25 The appellant did not challenge the correctness of the approach to 'a particular social group' stated by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">However, she argued that the Tribunal manifestly misunderstood that approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The appellant submitted that the written reasons of the Tribunal demonstrate that in considering the third matter identified in the quote from Applicant S above (ie whether the social group was distinguishable from the rest of society), the Tribunal actually tested whether women in Indonesia were cohesive or 'share interests, goals or aspirations'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The appellant pointed out that cohesiveness is not a necessary element of a particular social group; thus the Tribunal misunderstood the test to be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The Minister argued that the Tribunal's written reasons on 'a particular social group' demonstrate that the Tribunal gave significance to the integration of women into civil society and the conferral on them of the same rights and obligations as men, and not the cohesiveness or otherwise of Indonesian women as a social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">26 A fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons as a whole does not leave me with the impression that the Tribunal, under cover of silence, applied a test of whether women in Indonesian were cohesive or shared interests, goals or aspirations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Decision-makers, including judges, often raise issues and considerations in the course of a hearing that ultimately do not form part of their reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">So it was, in my opinion, here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">27 Further, the appellant is faced with the problem that the Tribunal concluded that the information it accepted 'does not indicate that perpetrators of sexual assault in Indonesia engage in this form of abhorrent criminal activity as a means of harming or persecuting ethnic Chinese women (or women) per se for that matter ' (the emphasis is mine but the punctuation is as in the original).</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Thereby, notwithstanding its finding that women in Indonesia are not a particular social group, the Tribunal appears to have concluded that, if they were, perpetrators of sexual assault do not commit their crimes as a matter of persecuting women as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The appellant asserts that the parenthetical 'allusion' to women in the Tribunal's conclusion is not sufficient to constitute a finding on this question, but I see no reason to read down what the Tribunal Member clearly enough said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The mispunctuation leads nowhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Issues 1(b), 5 and 6: The unavailability for Convention reasons of State protection against the feared persecution 
 
28 After rejecting the appellant's claims that her rapists were policemen, the Tribunal found:
 
 'The independent evidence...indicates that the state authorities are attempting to address the prevalence of rape in Indonesia by identifying the problem of under-reporting and establishing crises centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">According to the US State Department, in 2003 there was a 25 percent increase in the rape cases tallied by the Jakarta police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Rape is punishable by 4 to 12 years in jail, and the Government jailed perpetrators for rape and attempted rape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">During 2003, many police stations set up a "special crisis room" (RPK), where female officers received criminal reports from sexual assault victims.</sentence>

<sentence id="s153">
 

29 The Tribunal concluded that the Indonesian authorities do not 'generally' promote, condone, or permit the persecution of, or 'withhold reasonable protection' from, Chinese, Christians or ethnic Chinese and Christian women.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">It referred to evidence that recently a police chief in West Jakarta was replaced for allegedly blackmailing traders of traditional Chinese medicines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The Tribunal said that '[t]here was nothing in the independent evidence to satisfy the Tribunal that the [appellant] will be denied state protection for the reason of her ethnicity, religion or her membership of a particular social group of "ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">' The Tribunal was 'satisfied that if the [appellant] were to face harm from private individuals, adequate and effective state protection is available to her'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">30 The appellant submitted that, even if, upon analysis, she feared persecution only by a non-State actor for non-Convention reasons, the Tribunal erred by failing to consider whether there had been a failure by the Indonesian authorities, for Convention reasons, to provide protection to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The appellant relied on the observation in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 205 ALR 487 (' S152 ') that a state's inability to control the conduct of its police force may amount to a sufficient reason for a person to be unwilling to avail herself of the protection of her country of nationality once outside the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">That, however, assumes that a Convention reason is implicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">In oral submissions, the appellant submitted that, had the Tribunal applied the correct test, it would have been open to it to conclude that the failure by the authorities to protect the appellant was for a Convention reason: the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 (' Khawar ') is authority for the proposition that criminal activity committed by a private individual, which is tolerated or condoned by the State because it systematically discriminates on Convention grounds, may amount to persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">31 In considering whether effective state protection was available, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal was required to consider whether there was a reasonably effective and impartial police force and a reasonably impartial system of justice: see S152 at [26].</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The appellant argued that the Tribunal's reasoning reveals no consideration of whether effective state protection was available to the appellant 'on the ground' or at a 'micro' level, as was required: the question was, what would be available as a practical matter to a woman in the position of the appellant?</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">32 The appellant submitted that, had the Tribunal really questioned whether there was an effective and impartial police force and a reasonably impartial system of justice, as required by S152 , it would have dealt with the suggestion by the appellant's father that the police had not responded to his complaint of his daughter's rape because she is Chinese, and that the appellant was raped again after the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">33 The Minister conceded that the evidence dealt with by the Tribunal on the issue of state protection consisted of 'broad' considerations of what the state was attempting to do to remedy the problems of rape in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">However, the Minister submitted, that does not betoken jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The Tribunal was under no obligation to recite every piece of evidence before it, and especially not required to recite evidence it found unconvincing on an issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The Tribunal's conclusion that the Indonesian authorities do not 'generally' withhold protection should not be 'parsed' in order to concoct supposed error: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The Convention does not require absolute protection or guarantees against harm, as was correctly observed by the Tribunal in reaching its conclusion on the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">34 The Minister further argued that in a case of persecution by non-state agents the question of state protection may be relevant at three stages of the inquiry: whether the fear is well-founded; whether the conduct giving rise to the fear is persecution, and; whether the appellant is unable, or, owing to fear of persecution, unwilling, to avail herself of the protection of her state: S152 per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ at [21].</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">It was for this reason that the High Court allowed an appeal from the judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court in S152 that turned on a finding, similar to the appellant's argument in this appeal, that the Tribunal erred in failing to determine whether there was protection available 'in a practical sense'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">35 However, while the 'ability of the state to discharge its obligation to protect its citizens', may , as counsel for the Minister submitted, be relevant at three stages of the inquiry, it is here, in my view, relevant to the second question identified by Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ, viz 'whether the conduct giving rise to the fear is persecution' (at [21]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">If the state, despite the good intentions of its leaders, is not able, at what might be called the operational or grass-roots level, to have its operatives provide an acceptable level of protection against serious harm, and the dereliction of those operatives has as its basis their discrimination of a Convention kind against the appellant, that situation, as Hale LJ put it in Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000] 1 NLR 15, 'may turn the acts of others [ie non-state actors] into persecution for a Convention reason' (at 52 and quoted with approval by Lord Hope of Craighead in the appeal to the House of Lords (see [2000] UKHL 37 ; [2001] 1 AC 489 at 497)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">36 So much was uncontroversial in S152 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">S152 was a case where harm had been inflicted by non-state actors for Convention reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The majority in the High Court took the view that (at [26]):
 
 ' [n] o country can guarantee that its citizens will at all times, and in all circumstances, be safe from violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Day by day, Australian courts deal with criminal cases involving violent attacks on person or property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Some of them may occur for reasons of racial or religious intolerance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The religious activities in which the first respondent engaged ... evidently aroused the anger of some other people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Their response was unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The Ukrainian state was obliged to take reasonable measures to protect the lives and safety of its citizens, and those measures would include an appropriate criminal law, and the provision of a reasonably effective and impartial police force and justice system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">None of the country information before the tribunal justified a conclusion that there was a failure on the part of Ukraine to conform to its obligations in that respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">' 
 

37 In the present case, by contrast, (if the matter were sufficiently raised by the appellant), although the serious harm done to her by a non-state agent was not itself inflicted for a Convention reason, she might nevertheless be refugee if, for Convention reasons, namely, anti-Chinese racism merging into antipathy for Chinese women considered as a social group exhibited by the local police, the State failed, to provide a 'reasonably effective and impartial police force' (cf S152 at [26]) at a grass-roots level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">That is, the State's weakness or incompetence, whatever its leaders' good intention, in having its norms carried out, might have permitted the local police to engage in Convention persecution themselves, by failure (for Convention reasons) to prevent and act against those who would cause the appellant serious harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">38 As I read S152 , nothing in it, or otherwise in principle, denies that such a claim, if made out, may constitute the appellant a refugee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">She would be in her predicament because of the risk of serious harm coming to her for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">As the Convention definition puts it (see Article 1(A)(2)), she would be: 
 
 '...owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for [Convention reasons] ... outside the country of [her] nationality and ... , owing to such fear ... unwilling to avail [herself] of the protection of that country'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">
 

39 As the 'Michigan Guidelines', developed by Professor Hathaway and others, put it:
 
 'The causal link between the applicant's predicament and a Convention ground will be revealed by evidence of the reasons which led either to the infliction or threat of a relevant harm, or which cause the applicant's country of origin to withhold effective protection in the face of a privately inflicted risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Attribution of the Convention ground to the applicant by the state or non-governmental agent of persecution is sufficient to establish the required causal connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">' (See: Hathaway, 'The Michigan Guidelines on Nexus to a Convention Ground', Michigan Journal of International Law (2002) vol 23, pp 211-222 at 215.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">)
 

40 More specifically and authoritatively, in Khawar it was recognised that, as Gleeson CJ put it (at [30] --- [31]):
 
 'The references in the authorities to state agents of persecution and non-state agents of persecution should not be understood as constructing a strict dichotomy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Persecution may also result from the combined effect of the conduct of private individuals and the state or its agents; and a relevant form of state conduct may be tolerance or condonation of the inflicting of serious harm in circumstances where the state has a duty to provide protection against such harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">As was noted earlier, this is not a case in which it is necessary to deal with mere inability to provide protection; this is a case of alleged tolerance and condonation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">In Ex parte Shah , Lord Hoffmann, in giving the example of the Jewish shopkeeper set upon with impunity by business rivals in Nazi Germany, referred to the failure of the authorities to provide protection, based upon race, as an "element in the persecution".</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The same expression was used by Lord Hope of Craighead in the passage from Horvath quoted above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">
 
 Where persecution consists of two elements, the criminal conduct of private citizens, and the toleration or condonation of such conduct by the state or agents of the state, resulting in the withholding of protection which the victims are entitled to expect, then the requirement that the persecution be by reason of one of the Convention grounds may be satisfied by the motivation of either the criminals or the state.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">In relation to the case which Ms Khawar seeks to make out, the decision in Ex parte Shah in this respect is directly in point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">If her contentions, as to which no findings have yet been made, are correct, then Ms Khawar was being abused by her husband and his relatives for personal reasons, but her likely subjection to further abuse without state protection is by reason of her membership of a particular social group , if it be the case that women in Pakistan may be so described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">' (Footnotes omitted, emphasis added.</sentence>

 See also Khawar at [79]-[80], [87] and [114] ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">41 S152 effected no modification of Khawar .</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">
 
42 I turn now to the question: was the claim that the police at the local level had treated the appellant's complaint of rape with less than due seriousness for Convention reasons sufficiently raised so as to require the Tribunal to deal with it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">In my opinion it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">43 The Tribunal had before it material from the appellant's father which she and her father had wished to have considered by the relevant Australian authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Her father suggested that he was treated differently and less favourably, when he complained, by the local police, Muslims, because he was Chinese.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">It was elsewhere asserted in the materials relied on by the appellant that all the police are Muslims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The Refugee Advice and Casework Service (Australia) Inc ('RACS') had submitted on behalf of the appellant that she 'fears that the police and authorities in Indonesia will not protect her because of the fact she is a Christian Chinese...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Her solicitor had also submitted that the appellant's father had provided a statement detailing his experience with the police: 'He reported the matter to the police who took no action, he opined that it was due to the fact that he and his daughter were Chinese whereas the police and the rapist were Muslim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">' The appellant's solicitor, citing Khawar (at [29]), submitted that '[o]n its face, this is a further case of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Even if the original rape was not for a convention reason, the failure of the authorities to investigate and take action in respect of the rape can amount to persecution if such inaction was motivated by questions of race.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">' The Tribunal Member who first heard the appellant's case recorded that the appellant had 'also stated that her father and brother had reported the assault to the police but they took no action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The Indonesian authorities were not interested in protecting her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">' The Tribunal Member asked the appellant 'how, in her view, the police could have done anything without more information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">' According to the Member, the appellant did not respond to that question, but 'reiterated that the complaint was ignored because she was of Chinese descent so was ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">There were fights between Muslims and Chinese Christians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">'
 
44 The Tribunal appears to have accepted the appellant's claim that her attacker was a threat to her on account of her complaint to the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">It was also apparently accepted, at least, that the appellant had been raped; that this had been reported to the police; that they had, at best, done nothing useful directed towards apprehending the rapist, and that she had been raped again by the same man on account of the complaint to the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">45 In such circumstances, it behoved the Tribunal, in light of the several ways in which the appellant put her case, to examine whether the appellant might qualify for refugee status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">There is nothing abstruse or indirect in the proposition, which readily springs to mind, that despite anti-racist sentiments expressed and progress initiated at the highest levels of government, these may have had little effect at local police level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">46 This question should have been considered but was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It is true that the Tribunal found that:
 
 ' [T] he independent evidence ... indicates that the state authorities are attempting to address the prevalence of rape in Indonesia by identifying the problem of under-reporting and establishing crisis centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">... During 2003, many police stations set up a "special crisis room" (RPK), where female officers received criminal reports from sexual assault victims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">There is an active NGO movement in the country which is constantly raising awareness and assists in police addressing the problem of sexual assault [sic] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">' 
 
 
 
 

47 Apparently on that basis, the Tribunal continued:
 
 'The evidence before the Tribunal suggests that the Indonesian authorities do not generally promote, condone or permit persecution of [Chinese] , Christians or ethnic Chinese and Christian women in Indonesia or withhold reasonable protection, regardless of the position of the perpetrators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">The Tribunal notes that according to the US Department of State recently a police chief in West Jakarta was replaced for allegedly blackmailing traders of traditional Chinese medicines (see for example Country Reports on Human Rights Practices --- 2003, released by Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and labour, US Department of State, February 2004).</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The Tribunal is satisfied that if the [appellant] were to face harm from private individuals, adequate and effective state protection is available to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The Convention does not require absolute protection of an individual and state protection by no means implies that the authorities must or can provide absolute guarantees against harm ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S157/2003 [2004] HCA 18 at [26] and [28]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">There was nothing in the independent evidence to satisfy the Tribunal that the [appellant] will be denied state protection for the reason of her ethnicity, religion or her membership of a particular social group of "ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">' 
 

48 However, the appellant's claims and submissions mandated an inquiry into the prospect that she might be denied reasonable protection from the police charged with responsibilities in the area where she lived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">That question is distinct from whether at high levels or in other places in Indonesia the authorities were generally doing their reasonable, non-racist best.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Material from her father and from the appellant supported the proposition that the police at local level would treat her less favourably than indigenous Indonesians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The extent to which actual and practical, as distinct from legal, discrimination might operate against Chinese people, including women complaining of rape, appears to have provoked little, if any information at all as a result of the Tribunal's inquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">It appears not to have been, as it should have been, an actual focus of those inquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">49 Plainly the appellant's complaint about the local police, in the context of much material to suggest deep wells of anti-Chinese feeling in Muslim Indonesia, was not answered merely by reference to changes for the better at high levels of public administration in Indonesia since the departure of President Soeharto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">That the contemporary leaders of a society have enlightened views may say nothing about the situation at the level of grass-roots policing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Nor was it answered, as the Minister submitted, by reference to measures, apparently instituted in some localities, to address the general problem of rape by 'identifying the problem of under-reporting and establishing crisis centres'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The official encouragement of the reporting of rapes generally carries no implication that subsequent investigation would proceed on a basis that was not ethnically discriminatory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Encouragement of Indonesians generally to report rape to local police is one thing, the investigation by local police of reports by Chinese Indonesians is another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">50 The unexamined question was, in my opinion, sufficiently clearly an integer of her case to require consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">If it was not clearly and expressly so asserted in the ways referred to at [44] above, in my view it clearly arose on the materials before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">In NABE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 219 ALR 27 (' NABE ') the Full Court said (at [61]): 
 
 'We are of the view that the observations by Merkel J in Paramananthan , by the Full Courts in Sellamuthu and Sarrazola (No 2) and by Cooper J in SDAQ are consistent with the proposition that the tribunal is not required to consider a case that is not expressly made or does not arise clearly on the materials before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The tribunal's obligation is not limited to procedural fairness in responding to expressly articulated claims but, as is apparent from Dranichnikov , extends to reviewing the delegate's decision on the basis of all the materials before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">' 
 

51 Earlier the Full Court had approved (at [60]) some pertinent observations by Selway J in SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 199 ALR 364 at [17]-[18] : 
 
 '...But this does not mean that the application is to be treated as an exercise in nineteenth century pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">... 
 The question, ultimately, is whether the case put by the appellant before the tribunal has sufficiently raised the relevant issue that the tribunal should have dealt with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">' 


It would be strange if a claimant of refugee status were to be denied a right to have the substance of her claim considered, including the different ways in which the Convention might apply to her, because she had failed clearly to analyse those ways in her application and supporting material, although she had clearly enough delineated facts that might attract the salvation of the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">It is not likely that the Full Court in NABE intended such a thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">The Full Court was absolving the Tribunal from any duty to engage in subtle teasing out of hypotheses that only abstrusely arise from an applicant's account of the circumstances that have led to the claim of refugee status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">That is not the position here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">52 In my opinion, nothing in NABE was intended to deny, nor can it be denied, that to determine whether a claim 'clearly arises' on the material before a decision-maker, the decision-maker must fully understand the claim being made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">That, in turn, may in some cases make it necessary for the decision-maker to analyse what the appellant has said in terms of possible Convention categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">That was the position here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">53 In my opinion, failure to consider this matter constituted a constructive failure to exercise the Tribunal's jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">54 Nevertheless, whether such error ultimately has the effect of invalidating the Tribunal's decision depends on whether there was otherwise an independent, jurisdictionally robust basis, among those found by the Tribunal, for denying the appellant's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">In particular, the finding that the appellant feared persecution at the hands of one local man and that the appellant could avoid such threat as he might pose by relocating elsewhere in Indonesia is of potential significance here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Issue 1(c): Relocation 
 
55 The Tribunal Member's finding on this issue was:
 
 'Moreover, if the [appellant] remains fearful of her attackers in Jakarta, the Tribunal is satisfied that it is reasonable for the [appellant] to relocate to a different part of Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The focus of the Convention definition is not upon the protection that the country of nationality might be able to provide in some particular region, but upon a more general notion of protection by that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The international community is not under an obligation to provide protection outside the borders of the country of nationality if real protection can be found within those borders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Therefore, even if an applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution in their home region, the Convention does not provide protection if they could nevertheless avail themselves of the real protection of their country of nationality elsewhere within that country: Randhawa ... per Black CJ at 440-1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">
 The [appellant's] fear of harm is localised in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">The Tribunal does not accept that the man who assaulted her, although he may have persisted in locating her in Jakarta, would be able to find her anywhere in a densely populated country like Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">When the option of relocation was discussed with the [appellant] at the hearing, she stated that her husband had died, she was defrauded financially and most of her relatives are in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">While the Tribunal appreciates that the death of her husband in January 2001 and being financially defrauded soon after made life difficult for her, the [appellant] continued to work as [a real estate] agent until her departure from Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">She also possesses skills as a hairdresser and worked in that profession for many years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">In Australia, she was able to work until she was detained and has been able to find resourceful friends who have assisted her throughout her ordeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">The Tribunal did not find her to be as dependent as her witness tried to portray her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">She is relatively young, she was working in Indonesia prior to her departure and she has gained additional skills in Australia which would assist her if she were to search for employment opportunities elsewhere in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The Tribunal finds that it is reasonable for the [appellant] to relocate internally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">' 
 
 
 
 

56 The present and well-entrenched state of Full Federal Court authority is that a claim to refugee status is not established by those who could reasonably avail themselves of the real protection of the country of nationality elsewhere within their country of nationality: Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 (' Randhawa' ) per Black CJ at 440 (cf my remarks in dissent in NALZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 320 ; (2004) 140 FCR 270 at [8] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">The question is whether the person can relocate to another area of the country, and, it is said, whether he or she could reasonably be expected to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">However, answering this question is influenced by the principle that: 
 
 'notwithstanding that real protection from persecution may be available elsewhere within the country of nationality, a person's fear of persecution in relation to that country will remain well-founded with respect to the country as a whole if, as a practical matter, the part of the country in which protection is available is not reasonably accessible to that person' (per Black CJ in Randhawa at 442).</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">
 

57 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal incorrectly took a general approach that there must be a safe haven somewhere in Indonesia, and did not consider, as a matter of practical reality, the issues raised by the appellant as required ( Randhawa at 443).</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The appellant submitted that the specific issues which the Tribunal was obliged, but failed to consider were:
 
 
 
 1. the psychological difficulties of continuing to live anywhere within a country and culture in which the appellant had experienced rape on two occasions;
 2. the appellant's need, as a single mother (her husband having died in January 2001), for the support of her family;
 3. the appellant may face discrimination and/or harm living as a single woman with children without any family protection;
 4. the appellant has never lived outside Cenkarang (apparently a suburb of Jakarta) in Indonesia as a single woman; and
 5. the only family the appellant has who are outside Cenkarang live in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The Tribunal did not advert to the fact that all of the appellant's relatives living in Indonesia live in Cenkarang.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">
 
 

58 The Tribunal also failed to take into account its finding that the incidence of rape of women in Indonesia generally is a problem and the fact of a general social prejudice against ethnic Chinese Indonesians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">These are probable issues for the appellant, who would effectively be without family support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">In oral submissions counsel added that the Tribunal did not take into account that the appellant may have her children with her if she relocates, unlike her experience in Australia, which had encouraged the Tribunal to regard her as a relatively resilient person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">59 The Minister denied the claim that the Tribunal merely assumed there was a safe haven within Indonesia, and argued that it is for the Tribunal to determine the significant issues in assessing the matter of relocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">It cannot be assumed that, because the Tribunal has failed to refer expressly to an issue, it has failed to consider it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">The proper inference is that the issues referred to by counsel for the appellant were not considered by the Tribunal to be as significant as those the Tribunal mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Also, of the issues listed by the appellant's counsel, factors (1) and (3) go to whether the appellant would want to live in Indonesia at all, rather than to whether she could relocate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Issues (2) and (5) concern the appellant's wish to have family support, which was acknowledged by the Tribunal, and issue (4) could properly be considered not to carry great weight, given that the appellant had successfully made her way in the unfamiliar cultural environment in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">The brevity, it was submitted, of the Tribunal's reasons on this matter 'does not detract from the breadth of the consideration'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">60 In NAIZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 37 (' NAIZ ') at [22], Branson J (with whom North J agreed) found jurisdictional error on the part of a Tribunal Member who, though acknowledging that internal relocation should be 'reasonable' in the circumstances:
 
 '...did not, as ... Randhawa [at] [16] ... requires, give consideration to the practical realities facing the appellant [a widow of advancing years] with respect to accommodation and care should she seek to relocate within Fiji ... the Tribunal was required to give consideration to how, in a practical sense, the appellant could be expected to relocate within Fiji.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">' 
 

61 Here, the appellant was a Chinese Christian widow with young children who had been twice raped and who had never lived in Indonesia outside Jakarta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">True it is that she was enterprising and employable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">But on the material accepted by the Tribunal, anti-Chinese sentiment runs deep in Indonesia and the vulnerability of women to rape appears, from the Tribunal's findings, to be high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">62 It requires little empathy to understand that, although the appellant's precise fear of persecution as identified by the Tribunal relates to one man in Jakarta, she may well now suffer profound psychological difficulty in readjusting to Indonesian society and adjusting to a new place of residence in Indonesia at some place where, ex hypothesi , she appears likely to have no close family support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">To observe that she had suffered an 'ordeal', yet appeared capable in Australia, where the social environment is entirely different and she has family support, is simply not to acknowledge the major difficulty in the 'practical realities', both psychological and physical, that now would confront her if returned to Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Who would befriend her?</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">What support, if any, would be available?</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Would she be able to speak freely about her troubles (there is a suggestion in her materials, unexplored by the Tribunal, that even in Chinese-Indonesian circles shame attaches to a sexually assaulted woman)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Is a Chinese widow on her own in Indonesia especially apt to attract unwelcome sexual advances?</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">63 If a matter is not mentioned in a Tribunal's findings, this entitles a court to infer that the matter was not considered by the Tribunal to be material ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) at [69]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">That the Tribunal Member engaged in no discussion of questions of those kinds suggests that the psychological aspects of the practical realities facing the appellant were not present to his mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">Given the strangeness of such matters not having been mentioned if they were considered, in my view it is appropriate to draw the inference that they were not considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">I do not wish to seem overcritical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The appellant's case was not a simple one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">She had, according to the Tribunal, embroidered some facts and the Tribunal Member thought that a friend who gave evidence was suggesting that, even in the Australian context, she was less robust a person than the Tribunal considered her to be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Nevertheless, it is notorious that in the last 20 years or so the high potential for sexual assault, let alone repeated instances of it, to cause the victim serious psychological difficulties, has become widely accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">I think that the kinds of potential difficulties to which I have referred were overlooked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">There has in my opinion been, as in NAIZ , a failure by the Tribunal to ask itself (as Branson J put it) 'the right questions'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">64 It follows that there has been, on that account, given also the failure to consider fully the aspect of persecution by a non-State agent in which the State authorities at local level might, for Convention reasons, have been sufficiently legally implicated, a constructive failure of jurisdiction of a kind sufficient to invalidate the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Leave to raise new grounds 
 
65 Thus, in my opinion, some of the new legal arguments have merit and some have not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">They involve legal questions only and there is no possibility that they might have been countered in the Federal Magistrates Court by the calling of evidence by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">There is no acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below except that these cases are difficult and it is not uncommon for different minds to perceive different legal problems and arguments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">There has been little dislocation to judicial sitting time though some in relation to judgment-writing time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The case raises no new legal issues of wider importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">66 The appellant has, it has been twice found by the Tribunal, suffered grievously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Should she be wrongly returned to Indonesia to face the risk of further persecution, it would be a bad affair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">There is no clear pattern of acceptance by successive Ministers of humanitarian concerns expressed by judges in reconsideration under s 417 of the cases of persons whose applications have been rejected by the Tribunal and who have been shown to have no available curial remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">I am not, of course, critical of the relevant Ministers in that regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Nevertheless, I cannot assume that there is likely to be any acceptance of obvious humanitarian concerns for the appellant, if she is not permitted to rely on those of her intended new grounds that have merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">In short, much is at stake for her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">67 Apart from questions of costs, which can be adjusted (and I have no reason to think appropriate orders would be simply hollow), there is no actual prejudice to the Minister, except a degree of disruption to orderly administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">That degree is not, however, great.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">68 It does concern me that the appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court might as well have not occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">The time and energy of a busy member of that court was wasted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">It is inescapable that the integrity of the proper curial processes is, to an extent, dealt a blow if the appeal to this Court is upheld on grounds that could have been argued below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">69 Nevertheless, I think that, on terms as to costs, in the interests of justice leave to raise the new grounds should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">The general desirability that an applicant for refugee status should have her case determined according to law has added force here, on account of what the Tribunal found she has suffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Disposition 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Leave will be granted to amend the Notice of Appeal to rely on the grounds discussed at paragraphs 29-64 of these reasons and the Notice of Appeal will be deemed to stand to amended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">The orders of the Federal Magistrates Court except as to costs will be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">The decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal will be quashed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">The Tribunal will be ordered to reconsider the appellant's application according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">The first respondent will be ordered to pay only $3,000 by way of the costs of the proceedings in this Court (such sum being a figure commonly allowed as the costs of an application to the Federal Magistrates Court).</sentence>

 BACKGROUND 
 The Background Application 
 
1 This is an application for the issue of the constitutional writs of certiorari and prohibition together with an injunction, pursuant to section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and section 475A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") concerning a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("R R T") made on 9 June 2004 affirming a decision of the delegate of the Respondent not to grant the Applicant a Protection (Class XA) Visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Consistent with the decision of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162, I propose to make an order joining the R R T as the Second Respondent in the proceedings although for the purposes of these Reasons I will describe the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs as the Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The essential contention in this application is that the R R T fell into jurisdictional error by failing to conduct a review of the Respondent's decision and therefore failed to exercise the statutory jurisdiction since the Tribunal failed to properly consider whether the Applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations pursuant to section 36(2) of the Act as a refugee consistent with Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , 189 UNTS 150 and the 1967 New York Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees 606 UNTS 267 (and thus a person entitled to a protection visa pursuant to section 65 of the Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The failure to properly consider whether the Applicant is such a person is said to arise because the Tribunal failed to consider all elements of the Convention definition of "refugee" for the purposes of the Act , applied an adverse finding on credibility to a determination of all relevant factual questions, improperly relied upon apparent inconsistencies between the evidence of the Applicant and a Mr (Pastor) George Ddungu, failed to provide the Applicant with adequate particulars of the evidence of Mr Ddungu the Tribunal considered would form part of the reason for affirming the decision of the Delegate of the Respondent, failed to properly consider evidence establishing a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason (assuming findings on the question of credibility properly excluded particular evidence) and failed to have regard to relevant evidence which would have been decisive in the determination of the application in the Applicant's favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 The findings of the R R T on the question of the credibility of the Applicant and whether reliance could be placed upon any evidence of the Applicant, was a central matter to the claim that the R R T had failed to properly exercise the statutory jurisdiction of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The Background Facts 
 
4 The background facts put to the R R T in a statutory declaration from the Applicant dated 1 July 2003 in support of the review, are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">5 The Applicant is a Ugandan national from the Muganda tribe in central Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The Applicant was born on 25 December 1978.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Prior to departing Uganda for Australia in October 2002, the Applicant was the Assistant Pastor to the Christ Alive Church in Uganda and the full time coordinator of a project called Earthlife Uganda and a further project called the Progressive Farmers Club (a project designed to assist the poor to become involved in various income generating activities).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">6 The Applicant's father was killed when the Applicant was quite young.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Applicant's father had become involved in the activities of the Democratic Party opposed to the Government of President Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress Party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Applicant also became a member of the Democratic Party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Some years ago (approximately early 2000) a referendum occurred in Uganda to determine whether Uganda should adopt a party system called the "Movement System" proposed by President Museveni or whether Uganda should retain a multi-party pluralist electoral system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Applicant opposed the adoption of the Movement System and campaigned both generally and through the Church against that system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">As a result, the Applicant contends that he was harassed and beaten by "military men" who supported President Museveni and particularly a group described as the Kalangala Action Group led by Major Kakooza Mutaale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">7 Prior to the presidential elections on 12 March 2001, the Applicant became very politically active and outspoken against President Museveni in support of a presidential candidate, Mr Kizza Besigye.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Besigye contended that the government had become corrupt and characterised by cronyism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Besigye lost the presidential election and fled Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Applicant says he was actively involved in many rallies and campaigns which criticised President Museveni, travelled to numerous villages campaigning for Besigye and criticised President Museveni to the congregation attending the Applicant's Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 Immediately prior to the election (about five days) military men detained the Applicant at his workplace and questioned him about his opposition and two days before the election Major Kakooza Mutaale came to the Applicant's Earthlife workplace with soldiers, accused the Applicant of campaigning against the Government through the Church, arrested him, tortured and beat him and threatened to kill him unless he stopped criticising President Museveni.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The Applicant was released about 10 hours later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">9 The day before the election, military soldiers came to the Applicant's workplace and instructed him to convince children and other young men and women to support President Museveni.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Applicant refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">During one rally, children and young men and women were taken by military men, beaten and subjected to physical injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">10 After the 2001 election and President Museveni's success, Besigye supporters were frequently harassed, detained and often killed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">On several occasions, the Applicant was threatened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">On one occasion, the Applicant was detained for a day, interrogated about aspects of the activities of a group called the Allied Defence Force ("ADF") rebels fighting the Government and questioned about the Applicant's support for same sex relationships through various Church projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Applicant says he was further detained because of his support for Besigye, intimidated and went into hiding for three weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">11 In early June 2002, a man named Mugerwa Charles came to the Applicant's orphanage in difficult personal circumstances and stayed for approximately two weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">His three children, Ssewankambo, Judith and Oliver Charles were already living at the orphanage due to the circumstances confronting their father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Mugerwa Charles then left the orphanage to re-join his wife who had acquired a house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Later that month, Mugerwa Charles was arrested by military officials and brutally tortured and killed by the group led by Major Kakooza Mutaale because Mugerwa Charles was perceived to be a strong supporter of Besigye and had attended anti-government rallies with the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Mugerwa Charles may also have been an ADF rebel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">12 The Applicant conducted the funeral service for Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">After the funeral a group of five men in civilian clothes with guns came to the Applicant's office and said they wanted to take the three children of Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Applicant refused to deliver up the children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The men said they would give the Applicant time to deliver up the children and would return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">They said that if the Applicant failed to deliver up the children he would be killed like Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">13 During 2001, another incident occurred which the Applicant recounted to the R R T "for the sake of completeness" (Documents Book, p.94, para 25), in these terms:
 
 "During 2001 I was involved in an outreach ministry in northern Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The LRA ("Lords Resistance Army") rebels captured me and my colleagues and told me that because I was a pastor they wanted me to give information to the President.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I thought that they would take us to the Sudan where their base is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">They released us, but they said that if we went back again they would get us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Since my assistant was killed in December 2002 I have thought more about this and now I feel afraid that the LRA rebels might come to central Uganda and capture me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">" 
 
 

14 In early July 2002, the Applicant travelled to Nairobi, Kenya to apply to the Australian High Commission for a visa to travel to Australia to talk to various people about sustainable development projects the Applicant was coordinating in Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The visa was granted on 5 July 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">On 28 May 2002, the Applicant had obtained a visa to travel to Germany to attend a development workshop related to particular project work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">However, the Applicant elected not to travel to Germany but travelled to Australia arriving on 4 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">15 In December 2002, the Applicant received a telephone call from Mr George Ddungu, the Administration Manager of the Earthlife Uganda Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Mr Ddungu told the Applicant that the men who had previously sought the three children of Mugerwa Charles had returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">On learning that the Applicant was not in Uganda, the men abducted the Applicant's assistant Ssenyonga Robert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Ssenyonga Robert has not been heard of since.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">These men (soldiers) told people in the Earthlife Uganda Project office that the Applicant had assisted a rebel (Mugerwa Charles) and must also be a rebel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">George Ddungu told the Applicant not to return to Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The Applicant made arrangements for the three children of Mugerwa Charles to be taken to Kenya.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">16 The Applicant says that he knows he will be killed if he returns to Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">If he had been at his workplace in December 2002, the Applicant believes he would have been taken and killed instead of Ssenyonga Robert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The Applicant says he would be killed because he helped Mugerwa Charles who the government soldiers believed to be a rebel and an "armed thief".</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The second reason why the Applicant believes he would be killed is his refusal to hand over the three children of Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The Applicant believes that he is perceived by these soldiers and particularly the group led by Major Kakooza Mutaale, the Kalangala Action Group, to be a threat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The Applicant says he believes these soldiers act with the approval of the government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Applicant further says that these men who he describes as the "President's men" do not like him because he has persistently campaigned against President Museveni, he is a member of the Muganda tribe (President Museveni discriminates against Muganda people in favour of his own tribe, the Banyonkole tribe) and he counsels and assists homosexual men and lesbian women through the Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">17 In the application form for the protection visa, the Applicant was asked to answer the question, "What do you fear may happen to you if you go back to that country?</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">" [Uganda].</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Applicant wrote an extensive response to the question which appears at pages 57 to 63 of the document bundle dated 26 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In that response, the Applicant recites elements of the factual material reflected in the written statement put to the R R T in the statutory declaration dated 1 July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">On the issue of the events that occurred in the northern part of Uganda around the town of Gulu, the Applicant said this (page 61):
 
 "On top of that with my Church we have [been] doing outreach ministry not only to peaceful areas, but also to areas in the north ie --- Gulu as God has called us to proclaim Christ to all societies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The Kony rebels abducted two of our youth evangelistic team and later returned the next day without any problems to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">They were not hurt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">They said that when they come back they will need the leader of the team to be taken so that he can talk to the Government for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Failure to comply with what they say will mean death to the leader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">I am the leader of the crusades of our Church for the outreach ministries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">" 
 
 

18 In a submission to the R R T dated 29 January 2004, the Applicant identifies his claims for protection based upon a Convention ground of persecution in these terms:
 
 
 (a) by reason of the Applicant's political opinion which is actual or imputed, arising from his assistance to and protection of alleged rebel, Mugerwa Charles and his refusal to hand over the children of Mugerwa Charles to persons believed to be working for President Museveni; and
 (b) by reason of the Applicant's membership of a particular group arising from his assistance to and protection of alleged rebel Mugerwa Charles and his refusal to hand over the children of Mugerwa Charles to persons believed to be working for President Museveni.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 

19 The Applicant is thus unwilling to avail himself of the protection of his country of nationality owing to a well-founded fear that he would be persecuted for each of the reasons identified in [18].</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
 
20 The Applicant arrived in Australia on 4 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">21 The Applicant initially applied for a tourism visa on 11 December 2001 for the purpose of visiting a sponsor in Australia and to undertake a study tour relevant to projects undertaken by the Applicant in Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The application was rejected on 20 December on the ground that the stated intention of only visiting Australia was not genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">A further application was lodged on 3 July 2002 with supporting sponsor documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">At that time, the Applicant identified a number of reasons which strongly suggested an intention and need on the part of the Applicant to return to Uganda at the conclusion of the three month visiting program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Those reasons included the observation that people served by the Applicant in the Progressive Farmers' Club project would need his continuing assistance, his mother was seriously handicapped and in need of support (and his sister and only sibling was living outside Uganda), he was committed to his project work associated with the Earthlife Uganda project, he had enduring obligations to take care of his family's farm and he was not tolerant of the cold winters in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">22 In these applications, the Applicant did not foreshadow any apprehension about the matters of concern which were subsequently reflected in the protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">23 On 14 January 2003, the Applicant lodged an application for a protection visa with the Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">On 4 February 2003, the Respondent's delegate refused the grant of a protection visa and on 6 March 2003 the Applicant applied for a review of that decision to the R R T. 
 
24 On 11 August 2003, the Applicant lodged the statutory declaration sworn 1 July 2003 reciting the background facts described at paragraphs [4] to [16].</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">On 22 December 2003, the R R T invited the Applicant to attend a hearing before the Tribunal to give oral evidence in support of the claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The hearing occurred on 19 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Prior to the hearing, the Applicant lodged a document apparently signed (and so certified by a solicitor) by Pastor George Ddungu on 7 January 2004 under the heading Christ Alive Church , in these terms:
 
 "We requested Pastor [the Applicant] to remain in Australia for fear of his life at the beginning of last year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">He had travelled on our Church's responsibility to meet a few persons out there and on behalf of the Church's activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 
 We assisted a poor person who was a member of this Church and later he was killed in a safe house by the government soldiers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">They later came to our Church office asking to take the orphans which [the Applicant] resisted saying he was a voice of the oppressed and they said they would come back to fulfil their mission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 
 As Pastor [the Applicant] was in Australia, the same men came back and they wanted to take him to the barracks but because he was not available they took our assistant Administrator Pastor James whom we do not know where he is up to now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">They claimed that the man we assisted was a rebel belonging to ADF rebel group who are based in southern Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">They also claimed that he had guns and was linked to the above group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Because of our association with him as a Church goer, they linked us to the above said group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 
 Secondly, because of Pastor [the Applicant] political history, it steered them up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">We pray that you will continue rendering the necessary assistance as we are convinced that his return may cost his life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">So our Church is now under organisations listed as supporting rebels and security organs claim that we are rebels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Generally speaking all pastors from this Church are being harassed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">
 
 We also pray that the soldiers stop these acts of plunder and ... killing innocent people in this country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">" 
 
 

25 On 29 January 2004 the Applicant's advisers made a submission to the R R T addressing the basis for the Applicant's claims, the evidence, the statutory tests and various United States State Department Reports on Human Rights Practices surveys.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In the course of the hearing on 19 February 2004, the Applicant recounted aspects of the factual background described previously and gave further evidence described by the R R T in this way:
 
 "In November 2001 he [the Applicant] decided to go to the North with food and medicines for children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">While on the way, the convoy was intercepted by LRA rebels and the applicant claimed to have been captured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">He was asked where he was taking food.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">He was asked to tell the Government to stop attacking the LRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">He was ordered to speak to Government officials by phone to deliver this message.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Eventually, he and his driver were able to escape and eventually made their way back to Masaka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Thereafter, he moved from place to place, at times pretending to be mad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 The applicant claimed, that as a result of this experience, he had been branded a rebel and a supporter of the LRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">He decided to leave the country, which he did with the assistance of George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">
 
 At the conclusion of the hearing, the applicant said that, now even the children in his projects wanted to kill him, because they say he was involved in rebel activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">" 
 
 

26 On 21 February 2004 (apparently received on 24 February), the Applicant wrote to the R R T advising that there were some points that he thought were important that he had forgotten to mention because he had a headache during the course of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">A six page typewritten commentary was sent with a handwritten covering letter to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">As to the capture by the LRA rebels and the forced telephone call to Government officials, the Applicant provided the following additional detail:
 
 "The rebels seemed as if they wanted to free us soon after my forced telephone talk, because they said that if we came back to the north they would get us and that because I went for prayer, if anything happens to them they would kill me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">They said that they have their informers also in the central part where I come from.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">They also said that they are also part of the Uganda People Defence Force (Army).</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The Ugandan Army is spread all over and so that also increased my fear and also to see that their informers are everywhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">After the telephone talk they wanted to take us to their base in southern Sudan to be trained and fight, but we managed to escape from them as they went to raid for food.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">" 
 
 

27 The second topic dealt with in the written submission dated 21 February 2004 concerned a letter dated 20 July 2003 written by LRA rebels and a further letter dated 27 January 2004 written by the rebels, delivered to either the Church or one of the project offices where the Applicant previously worked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">George Ddungu recounted the content of the letters to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The Applicant described them in this way: "The rebels dropped a letter saying that they need my head with the help of their informers in Kampala and Masaka where I live they will be able to get me; they dropped a similar letter on 27 January 2004 [saying] that they had not forgotten me that they will still pursue me and cut my head off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">They also wrote in this letter that I escaped from them and so they want to teach me how to obedient to them a little bit more by cutting my head off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">" 
 
28 On the question of the dominating influence of the LRA rebels (and the capture of the Applicant by the rebels) in the Applicant's fear of persecution, the Applicant made these further observations:

<sentence id="s120">

29 The third matter dealt with in the submission concerned aspects of the Presidential election in 2001 and particularly the conduct of supporters of President Museveni and as an illustration of continuing arbitrary arrest and killing in safe houses the Applicant stated: "In addition to Mugerwa Charles, Pastor James and the three children, I can name many more people killed in safe houses, because of being part of the reform agenda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">When Pastor James was taken they were still pursuing me and also at the time of the death of the children even until now.</sentence>

30 The Applicant returned to the issue of his capture by the LRA on page 5 of the submission and said, "The Government failed to understand when I went and got abducted by the LRA rebels in the north.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">They have said that [I] am part of the rebels" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">31 On 26 February, the Tribunal made telephone contact with George Ddungu in Uganda to enquire about aspects of the circumstances confronting the Applicant in Uganda and the challenges confronting the Christ Alive Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The Tribunal member's note of that discussion with Mr Ddungu is contained at page 17 of the supplementary bundle of relevant documents dated 26 September 2005 and is in these terms: 
 
 "Note for file N03/47963 
 
 Conversation with Mr George Ddungu 
 
 The applicant had submitted two documents purporting to be faxes received from Mr. George Ddungu, his former supervisor in the Christ Alive church in Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">He also had made several references --- both oral and in writing --- to telephone conversations with Mr Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">I therefore decided to telephone Mr Ddungu at the phone number on the documents submitted by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The call was made in the evening of 26 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The number I called was 256-75-690099.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">I asked to speak to George Ddungu and the person who answered the phone identified himself as Mr. Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">
 
 I explained who I was and said that I wanted to talk with him about the applicant's situation in Uganda and the situation of his church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">I took notes of the conversation as it occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">
 
 The following is a summary of the main points of the conversation: 
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The only problem the applicant has is because of his activities in the north of Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">In 2001, the applicant travelled to the north of Uganda twice a month, because he was in charge of the church's northern programs and made monthly reports on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The children who died in Kenya died of a disease which was prevalent in the camp in which they were living.</sentence>

<sentence id="s146">The church has contacted the Uganda Human Rights Commission about its situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">

<sentence id="s148">The church was tipped off by immigration authorities that the applicant should leave the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">
 
 
 
 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The church's programs in the north continue and the church is in contact with other churches, including the Catholic Church, regarding its programs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">
 
 
 
 
 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The church's orphanages are in Masaka and in Kampala.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Most of the children are in Kampala.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">
 
 
 
 
 
 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The security people want the applicant to make a statement about the programs in the north.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">But one cannot discriminate --- one cannot know if a child is the child of a rebel if it needs shelter or has HIV/aids.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">
 
 
 
 
 
 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Security people came to the Kampala office, but Mr. Ddungu told them that the church had written to the Human Rights Commission and had contacted a lawyer, so they went away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">
 
 
 
 
 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">He could not go to Kampala office and was in a temporary office the church had in Masaka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">
 
 
 
 
 
 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The applicant could not survive in Uganda --- it was even necessary to bribe people at the airport because he was on a wanted list.</sentence>

 27 February 2004" 
 
 

32 On 27 February 2004, the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant in order to provide certain information arising out of the discussion with Mr Ddungu for the purposes of section 424A of the Act .</sentence>

33 On 11 March 2004, the Applicant responded to the letter of 27 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">In response to the six matters, the Applicant said this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">On 6 January 2001, the Applicant became chairman of the "Evangelistic Committee" of the Church which compelled the Applicant to travel to northern Uganda and particularly the districts of Gulu (in the north), Lira (in central to northern Uganda), Apach (northern district), Moyo and Kitgum (in the north).</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">People had fled particularly from Gulu and Lira to the Apach district due to the activity of LRA rebels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The Applicant visited Gulu reserve camps characterised by high death rates of children from hunger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The Applicant felt a pastoral obligation to be with children sleeping on the streets apparently in fear of being captured by LRA rebels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The Applicant conducted, with others, Church services to help raise finance to make travel to northern Uganda and particularly Gulu possible to address the problems in the north.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The Applicant repeated that during travel to the north he "was abducted by LRA rebels and forced to talk to the Government officials on the phone" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">34 On the issue of the abduction and escape of the Applicant, the further following remarks were put to the Tribunal:
 
 "My main problem is as a result of my abduction by the LRA rebels and my forced telephone conversation to the Uganda government officials on the 21 st November 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Which led to the government failure to understand that [I] am not an LRA rebel and thus their pursue of me as a rebel even until now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">At the same time our release by the main boy who was the main guard after he was overpowered by my colleague by saying 'Go' in his northern language (during which time the others had gone to raid for food) marked our release when the boys said 'go' and thus our escape from all the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Thus the LRA rebels need me because they said I prayed and cursed them and because I also escaped from them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">" 
 
 

35 The Applicant further described the letters of 20 July 2003 and 27 January 2004, claimed that George Ddungu could not talk to the Applicant on the telephone nor send faxes because of Government spies, discussed the conduct of Kony rebels, the perception of the Government that the Applicant is a rebel arising out of the forced telephone conversation, the difficulty presented by central LRA rebels and their informers and the difficulty of seeking asylum in Kenya because of the conditions prevailing in Kenya and the practice of the Kenyan Government of sending asylum seekers back to Uganda where such returnees are killed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">As to the three children of Mugerwa Charles, the Applicant said, "I also wanted Mugerwa's children to be taken to a different country, but it did not happen, consequently their death of which [I] am far beyond sure that they were killed by the same security personnel who were pursuing them and killed their Dad" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">36 The Applicant sums up his response to the reference by George Ddungu to the Applicant's "only problem" being his activities in the north of Uganda, as a reference to the Applicant's trip to Gulu, his abduction by LRA rebels, his forced telephone discussion with Government officials, the resultant perception on the part of the Government that the Applicant is an LRA rebel and the lack of protection that will be afforded to him by the Government of Uganda for that reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">37 The Tribunal reviewed the applications of 11 December 2001 and 3 July 2002 for a tourism visa by the Applicant and the notes of interview between the Applicant and a staff member of the High Commission of Australia in Nairobi in July 2002 concerning the Applicant's proposed trip to Germany on the night of that interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">On 12 March 2004, the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant putting particular information to the Applicant for the purposes of section 424A of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The letter is in these terms:

 The Tribunal has information that would, subject to any comments you make, be the reason, or part of the reason, for deciding that you are not entitled to a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">
 
 The information is as follows: 
 
 In the course of your hearing on 19 February and subsequently in written communications from your adviser, you claimed that you were abducted by the LRA on or about 21 November 2001 and obliged to make a compromising phone call to Government officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">You told the Tribunal that, on return to Masaka, you went into hiding for three weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">
 
 However, your visa application submitted by you in Nairobi on 11 December 2001 had attached to it supporting documents from the Bukoto Catholic Parish dated 26 November 2001, from the Butego Progressive Farmers Club dated 12 November 2001 and from the Progressive Institute of Business Studies Ltd dated 29 November 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The last of these states that you were a student, pursuing a two-years course leading to a Diploma in Tourism and that you were 'hard working, co-operative and willing to learn'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">
 
 You collected your passport with your visa for Australia in Nairobi on 5 July 2001 [this date ought to have been 5 July 2002] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">In an interview with the Australian High Commission, at that time, you said that you had to return to Uganda because you had a sick mother and that her only other child, your sister, was living in the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">You stated that you were going to a workshop in Germany that night.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">You stated that your Australian sponsors had taken over your education when your father died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Papers attached to your visa application indicated that the sponsorship started when you were twelve.</sentence>

 This information is relevant because: 
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>

 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">None of the documents submitted when you sought your visa for Australia nor your statements in interviews with the Australian High Commission made any reference to responsibility for church work in or visits to northern Uganda or involvement with an orphanage.</sentence>

 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Although you received your visa in July 2001 [this date ought to have been July 2002] , you returned to Uganda and did not leave for Australia until October, raising doubts about your claim to have at that time feared persecution.</sentence>

38 On 30 March 2004, the Applicant responded to the letter of 12 March.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">On the question of whether the Applicant was genuinely in northern Uganda in November 2001 having regard to the apparent inconsistencies arising out of the documents described in the letter of 12 March 2004, the Applicant said this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">The Applicant was in northern Uganda in November 2001 and was abducted by LRA rebels on 21 November 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The Applicant then went into hiding in a particular home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The Applicant's assistant, Robert, collected the Australian visa forms from the Canadian Consular Office and the documents attached to the visa application including the support letters from the Progressive Farmers' Club project, the Butego project and the Bukoto Catholic Parish Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Robert also collected a support letter from the Progressive Institute of Business Studies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">All these documents were taken to the Applicant in hiding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">They were filled out by the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Robert then sent them by registered mail to the Australian High Commission in Nairobi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The Applicant denied that he had travelled away from his hiding place at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">39 As to the failure to mention in the visa application any reference to responsibility on the part of the Applicant for Church work or Church visits to northern Uganda or involvement with an orphanage, the Applicant said this: "we decided that we do not mention much about my work and my employment commitments ie Earthlife, Christ Alive and my involvement in the north as this would lead into my mentioning my abduction by the LRA and my forced telephone conversation by the LRA to the Government officials that right now has put me in a state of conflicting loyalty about my continued living.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">This alone would lead the Australian High Commission to know about my fear and thus learning that I was going to seek asylum in Australia hence their rejection of the visa" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">40 Unfortunately, the letter of 12 March 2004 from the R R T incorrectly makes a reference to the collection by the Applicant of a visa for Australia on 5 July 2001 rather than 5 July 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">This caused the Applicant to extensively respond to the impossibility of collecting a visa in July 2001 which was applied for in December 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">41 The Applicant rebuts the notion that he left Uganda in periods between December 2001 and his date of departure for Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The Applicant returns to the matter of electing not to disclose to the Australian High Commission aspects of his involvement in Church work as that would necessarily involve disclosure of the contended abduction by LRA rebels in northern Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">For the same reason, the Applicant did not mention any aspects of his role at the orphanage or the problems concerning Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The Applicant asserts that he remained in hiding, was fearful for his life and anxious that he may not be able to leave Uganda for Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The Applicant described his arrangements with his Australian sponsors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">In relation to his German hosts or sponsors (the subject of the proposed visit to Germany based on a visa of 2 June 2002 disclosed to the Australian High Commission as background to the application for the 5 July 2002 Australian visa), the Applicant said this: "About the workshop, that I had to attend at that night in Germany, after informing my hosts in Germany that I wanted also to seek asylum there when I go, they informed me that they were to meet me in Uganda instead and thus my not travelling to Germany that particular night" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">42 On 12 May 2004, the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant in the following terms:
 "Australian Government 
 Refugee Review Tribunal 
 
 [The Applicant]
 
 12 May 2004 
 
 Dear [the Applicant]
 
 Your Application for Review 
 
 The Member reviewing your case has asked me to advise you as follows: 
 
 I have carefully reviewed all the claims and evidence before me and find I have a number of difficulties with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">
 
 In relation to the points put to the applicant post-hearing, I accept that the applicant did not travel to Nairobi in mid-December 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">However, the letter from the Progressive Institute of Business is dated in the middle of the period in which the applicant claims to have been in hiding and almost three weeks after his claimed trip to northern Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Irrespective of who collected the letters submitted with his visa application, it does not appear from the documents submitted that he was absent either from his studies or from his work in this period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">
 
 If one adds together the information supplied to the High Commission, which the applicant has not denied, the information supplied by the applicant in his primary and review applications and the information supplied by George Ddungu, which the applicant has also not denied, it would appear that, during 2001, the applicant travelled twice a month for his church to northern Uganda, started building a house, took care of a farm, took care of his blind and inform mother, was a valued employee of Earthlife Uganda and the Butego Progressive Farmers Association and was a conscientious student of tourism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">While I could accept that one person could do some of these things, I do not accept that one person could do them all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">
 
 However, my principal concern regarding the applicant's claims lies in the inconsistencies in his own evidence over time and the conflict with what I was told by George Ddungu, his former colleague in Christ Alive Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">
 
 
 
 
 (a) In his primary application, the applicant claimed that the LRA had abducted two of his youth evangelistic team, but let them go later, saying that they would need the leader of the team, so he could talk to the Government for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Failure to comply would mean the death of the leader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">
 
 (b) In his primary application, the applicant stated that he was asked during the 2001 Presidential election campaign to preach on behalf of President Museveni.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">He stated that his answer was that he was a pastor who did not involve himself in politics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">
 
 (c) In the statutory declaration of 1 July 2003 accompanying his review application, he claimed that he and colleagues were captured, but were released and told that they would be killed if they returned to the north.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">There is no mention of colleagues being abducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">
 
 (d) In the same statutory declaration, he referred in detail to his involvement in the 2001 Presidential election campaign on behalf of Col. Besigye, the opposition candidate, to being detained, to going into hiding and to being beaten on a number of occasions --- to none of which he had referred in his primary application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">
 
 (e) At hearing, he claimed that he escaped from the LRA, but only after being obliged to talk by telephone on the LRA's behalf to Government officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">
 
 These claims are not consistent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">
 
 
 
 
 Moreover, George Ddungu made no reference to the applicant having been captured and stated that the Government interest in him was only because of the work of the Church in northern Uganda, for which the applicant was responsible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">This also contradicted the applicant's claims to have aroused the negative interest of security authorities because of his assistance to Mugerwa Charles and his children or because of his counselling of homosexuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Moreover, George Ddungu also stated that the Church's work in northern Uganda continued, in collaboration with other churches, which calls into question the claim that this work had caused Government authorities to harass the Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">He also contradicted the applicant's claim that no complaint had been made to the Uganda Human Rights Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Finally, he stated that the immigration authorities advice that the applicant should leave the country prompted his departure, contradicting the applicant's claim to have heard it at the airport on departure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">
 
 His own inconsistencies weigh heavily against the credibility of the applicant's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">George Ddungu, in his written evidence and in conversation with me, clearly wanted to support the applicant, even though his evidence was not entirely consistent with what the applicant had claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">However, I have some reservations about his own reliability, since I called him to the number shown on his correspondence for his Kampala office, whereas he told me he had moved to Masaka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">
 
 Regarding the applicant's explanation as to why he did not go to Germany, the letter from the High Commission initially rejecting his visa application stated that the High Commission did not believe that his expressed intention only to visit Australia was genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">He then went to considerable lengths to satisfy the High Commission as to the genuineness of his intention to return to Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">When he received his visa, he told the Australian High Commission that he was leaving for Germany that night.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">His claim as to why he did not go to Germany means, therefore, that, later on that same day, he called Germany from Nairobi and told his hosts that he would apply in Germany for asylum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">In view of his experience with the Australian authorities, I find it inconceivable that he would do such a thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">It is much more likely that the applicant obtained the German visa to bolster his claim for an Australian visa and that no trip to Germany was ever planned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">In view of all the above, I have great doubts about the credibility both of the applicant and of George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">
 
 You are invited to comment on this information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">Your comments are to be in writing and in English.</sentence>

43 On 27 May 2004 (apparently received on 1 June 2004), the Applicant responded to this lengthy letter by making a submission set out at pages 48 to 55 of the Supplementary Bundle of Relevant Documents dated 26 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">The Tribunal extensively considered the submission, evaluated the responses contained within it and summarised its assessment of the response in this way ( Bundle of Relevant Documents , 26 October 2004, page 345): 
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The explanations given to the Australian High Commission were necessary as, if [the Australian High Commission] had found out about his intention to seek asylum, he would have been denied a visa; 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">His work in family commitments were made possible because he had employees assisting him to build his house, run his farm and look after his mother; 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">The youth workers were abducted but died later of Ebola disease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">However, these are not the reasons he was seeking protection, which was his 'fear to die due to my abduction by the LRA and my forced telephone conversation to the government officials by the LRA on the 21 st November 2001 and consequently the unending pursuit of me by both parties for which reason I am seeking protection'; 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Regarding the 2001 Presidential campaign, the Applicant repeated his claim to have campaigned for the opposition candidate, but did not address the fact that he had made no reference to this claim in his primary application; he repeated that the basis of his claim was as set out in para 3 immediately above; 
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Regarding the inconsistency between his primary claim, involving the claimed capture of two colleagues by the LRA and the statutory declaration accompanying his review application, in which this is not mentioned, the Applicant misunderstood the question as referring to the owners of the vehicle in which he was travelling when captured and did not address the inconsistency; however, he stated that their capture was not the reason why he was seeking protection, but, rather it was the reasons referred to in para 3 above; 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Regarding his failure to mention earlier his involvement in the presidential campaign and the consequential beatings, detention and being forced into hiding, he stated that he was not aware of how much detail was required when he made his primary application;

 THE DECISION, FINDINGS AND REASONS FOR DECISION OF THE REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
 
44 The Tribunal reviewed the facts reflected at paras [4] to [16], the articulated basis for the claim for a well-founded fear of persecution identified at para [18], the chronology of events, documents and correspondence described at paras [21] to [43] and made the following findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">The evidence put before the Tribunal reflected a number of inconsistencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Those inconsistencies apparent to the R R T were put to the Applicant in the letters of 12 March 2004 and 12 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The responses contained in the submissions made by the Applicant on 30 March 2004 and 1 June 2004 failed to resolve, for the R R T, the apparent inconsistencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">45 Some of the "difficulties" confronting the R R T arising out of the failure by the Applicant to properly address apparent inconsistencies were described as "peripheral" to the Applicant's central claims and although the R R T was not satisfied that its concerns about those matters had been addressed, the R R T nevertheless disregarded those concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The matters peripheral to the central claims included such factual assertions as the volume of tasks the Applicant claimed to perform while travelling regularly to the north of the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The R R T also had reservations about the Applicant's claims of involvement in the 2001 presidential election campaign.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">46 The R R T observed that in the response of 1 June 2004, the Applicant made it plain that his application for protection is based principally on a well-founded fear arising out of his encounter with the LRA and the consequences of that encounter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">The R R T expressed its assessment of the evidence of the Applicant and the credibility of the Applicant in these terms:
 
 "I do not accept his explanation for the fact that he made no mention of having been abducted by the LRA in his primary application [that is, the application for the protection visa].</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">
 
 Such a critical event in his life, with all the consequences which he later claimed flowed from it, does not fall into the category of 'detail' which he claimed he was originally not aware that was required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">
 
 Accordingly, I do not accept that the events surrounding his claimed abduction occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">
 
 I do not accept that he was abducted or that he was obliged to telephone Government officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">
 
 It follows that I do not accept that, as a result, he was obliged to go into hiding on return to Kampala or Masaka or that he was harassed by Government officials as a result of his visit to the north and his contact with the LRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">
 
 The Applicant's explanation as to why he did not go to Germany lacks all credibility and further undermines the credibility of his claims in general.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">" 
 
 

47 As to the relevance of the Applicant's engagement with the Australian High Commission, the R R T said this:
 
 "He had gone, on his own admission, to considerable lengths to hide his true intentions from the Australian authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">The letter from the High Commission initially rejecting his visa application stated that the High Commission did not believe that his expressed intention only to visit Australia was genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">He then went to considerable lengths to satisfy the High Commission as to the genuineness of his intention to return to Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">He told the Australian High Commission that he was leaving for Germany that night.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">His response to the Tribunal's letter asks the Tribunal to accept, therefore, that, on that same day, he called Germany from Nairobi and told his hosts that he would apply in Germany for asylum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">
 
 In view of his experience with the Australian authorities, I find it inconceivable that he would do such a thing --- inevitably prompting the reaction that he claims he received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">
 
 I find that the Applicant obtained the German visa to bolster his previously rejected claims for an Australian visa and that no trip to Germany was ever planned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">" 
 
 

48 Having made an assessment of the truthfulness of the Applicant's evidence, the R R T made the following findings:
 
 "Because of my general problems with the Applicant's credibility, I am unable to accept his claim to have supported Mugerwa Charles and to have refused to hand over his children, a claim further undermined by his attempt to implicate his alleged persecutors in the deaths of the children, which George Ddungu ascribed to disease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">
 
 Similarly, I do not accept that he was being harassed by the authorities because he counselled gay and lesbian people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">
 
 In short, I find the Applicant's evidence as to his own circumstances completely unreliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">
 
 I do not accept that the Applicant was captured by the LRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">
 
 I do not accept that he is sought by official or unofficial agents of the Ugandan Government or of the LRA or is in any other way under threat from them for any reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">
 
 I do not accept that he is under any threat from the people who were dependent on the projects he used to run.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">
 
 I do not accept that his mother has been attacked by people looking for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">
 
 I do not accept that he had to bribe his way out of Uganda or to obtain a passport or that he was advised at the airport (or at any other time) not to return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">" 
 
 

49 Thus, the R R T concluded that the Applicant had not demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason and that, on the evidence, the R R T was not satisfied that the Applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations for the purposes of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees .</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">THE GROUNDS OF THE APPLICATION 
 
50 The grounds of the application are:
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">The applicant was denied procedural fairness in that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) on 26 February 2004, in the absence of the Applicant, the Tribunal heard evidence by telephone from one George Ddungu ("Mr Ddungu"); 
 
 (b) the Tribunal failed to address questions to Mr Ddungu on matters likely to be within his knowledge and relevant to the review; 
 
 (c) the Tribunal failed to give to the applicant any or any adequate record or transcript of the evidence of Mr Ddungu; 
 
 (d) the Tribunal failed to give to the Applicant any or any adequate particulars of the evidence of Mr Ddungu that the Tribunal considered would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the Decision of the Delegate; 
 
 (e) the Tribunal failed to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable or at all, that the Applicant understood why the evidence of Mr Ddungu, or a part of the evidence, was relevant to the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">The Tribunal purported to make the Decision of the Tribunal without jurisdiction because: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) it made an adverse finding against the applicant founded on what it said was his explanation for the fact that he made no mention of having been abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army ("LRA") in his application for the Visa whereas the applicant did mention having been abducted by the LRA in the application; 
 
 (b) it made adverse findings against the applicant founded on the erroneous adverse finding referred to in subparagraph (a); 
 
 (c) in the premises, the Tribunal failed to review the Decision of the Delegate in accordance with section 414 of the Migration Act or at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">There was no evidence, or any sufficient evidence, before the Tribunal to support findings that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the events surrounding the applicant's claim that he was abducted by the LRA did not occur; 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the applicant was not abducted by the LRA; 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the applicant was not obliged by the LRA to telephone Government officials; 
 
 (d) the applicant was not obliged to go into hiding on returning to Kampala or Masaka; 
 
 (e) the applicant was not harassed by Government officials as a result of his visit to the north of Uganda and his contact with the LRA;

 (h) the trip to Germany was never planned; 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the applicant did not support one Mugerwa Charles and did not refuse to hand over his children; 
 
 (j) the applicant was not harassed by the authorities because he counselled gay and lesbian people; 
 
 (k) the applicant's evidence as to his own circumstances is completely unreliable; 
 
 (l) the applicant is not sought by official or unofficial agents of the Uganda Government or the LRA and is not under threat from them for any reason; 
 
 (m) the applicant is not under threat from the people who were dependent on the projects he used to run; 
 
 (n) the applicant's mother has not been attacked by people looking for the applicant; 
 
 (o) the applicant did not have to bribe his way out of Uganda or to obtain a passport;

 THE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE 
 
51 On the hearing of the application, the Applicant sought leave to read two affidavits sworn by the Applicant on 13 May 2005 and 29 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">As to the affidavit of 29 June 2005, the Applicant exhibits 11 documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">The first six exhibited documents already form part of the record being the letter from the R R T to the Applicant dated 27 February 2004, the Applicant's submission to the R R T dated 11 March 2004, the R R T's letter to the Applicant dated 12 March 2004, the Applicant's response dated 30 March 2004, the R R T's letter to the Applicant dated 12 May 2004 and the Applicant's reply dated 27 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">The remaining exhibits (7 to 11) supported by paras 8 to 21 of the affidavit address the recollections of and circumstances surrounding the discussion between the Tribunal member and George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Exhibit 8, for example, is an affidavit by George Ddungu deposing to George Ddungu's recollection of the telephone conversation on 26 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Exhibit 10 is an unsworn typewritten affidavit by George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Exhibit 11 is a facsimile of a sworn version of exhibit 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Exhibit 9 is the handwritten notes of George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">52 The Respondent objects to the admission of the affidavit on two grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">First, to the extent that the affidavit seeks to put before the Court the documents marked as exhibits 1 to 6, the documents are already before the Court and the affidavit adds nothing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">As to paras 8 to 21 and exhibits 7 to 11, the Respondent says the affidavit ought not to be admitted because the evidence is irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">The facts deposed to and documents exhibited do not go to any ground forming part of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">The application does not involve any allegation of bias, bad faith or improper purpose on the part of the Tribunal member in conducting the conversation, noting the conversation or relying upon the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">The Applicant simply seeks to adduce evidence which demonstrates that minds might legitimately differ about the recollections of the content of the conversation notwithstanding that the Tribunal member's typewritten note of the discussion on 26 February 2004 was made contemporaneously on 27 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">53 In Waco v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; 131 FCR 511; Lee, Hill and Carr JJ found the Tribunal had failed to afford procedural fairness to the applicant for a Protection Visa by finding letters central to the applicant's claim (submitted after the conclusion of the hearing) were not genuine, without giving the applicant an opportunity to be heard on that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">On the question of the evidential burden, their Honours at [58] said: 
 
 "It will not be necessary for the party alleging unfairness to put before the court the evidence which he would have presented had there not been a miscarriage of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">It is sufficient in such a case that the party has not been afforded an opportunity to put his or her case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">Only where the case is one where it can be shown that the Appellant could not, even if given the opportunity to do so, affect the outcome would it be held that there was no denial of procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">If the possibility exists that the Appellant, if given the opportunity might be able to make submissions or call evidence which could affect the outcome, the Appellant will not fail merely because the Appellant has not proved that the submissions or evidence would affect the outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">" 
 
 

54 Although it is not necessary for a party to put on evidence of the content of a possible response, evidence of that response or the possibility of a response that might have revealed evidence affecting the outcome may be admissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">It is not admissible for the purpose of establishing a controversy of fact or merits as to whether the Tribunal member said something or failed to properly record or appreciate something said by George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">In this case, the Tribunal put its concerns about a conversation with George Ddungu to the Applicant on 27 February 2004 and made reference to apparent inconsistencies arising out of the discussion with George Ddungu in the R R T's letter to the Applicant on 12 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">The Applicant had an opportunity to put information concerning a possible contradictory version of the conversation to the R R T from 27 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Moreover, the affidavit is not relevant to a ground of challenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">The particular ground of challenge going to the conversation with George Ddungu asserts a denial of procedural fairness arising out of a failure by the R R T to put all aspects of the conversation recorded by the Tribunal member to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">55 The proposition is that had all elements of the conversation been put to the Applicant, the Applicant might have said something further in response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">The question is whether there was a failure to afford procedural fairness in not putting all the elements of the conversation as noted by the Tribunal, to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">If the purpose of the affidavit is to contradict the Tribunal member's version of the conversation reflected in the typewritten note of 27 February 2004, no doubt the Respondent would seek to address the contention with evidence from the Tribunal member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">However, paragraphs 8 to 21 and exhibits 7 to 11 of the affidavit of the Applicant sworn 29 June 2005 will be admitted into evidence solely on the basis that the facts deposed to and the documents exhibited reflect things which might have been said or put to the R R T had points 7 to 11 of the conversation [31] in the note dated 27 February been put to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">56 The affidavit of 13 May 2005, deals with attempts by the Applicant to obtain the Tribunal member's handwritten notes of the conversation with George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Perhaps it is thought the handwritten notes will be inconsistent with the typewritten note of 27 February 2004 [31] or that propositions put to the Applicant in the letter of 27 February 2004 [32] were not a fair representation of what was actually said by George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Evidence directed to attempts to secure a handwritten note of the conversation which took place on 26 February 2004 are not relevant to the question of whether the Applicant was denied procedural fairness by reason of: 
 
 &#8226; points 7 to 11 in the note of the conversation not being put to the Applicant; 
 &#8226; the Applicant not being present when the conversation took place;
 &#8226; the Tribunal member failing to ask the correct questions; or
 &#8226; the Tribunal member failing to ensure the Applicant understood the evidence of George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">

57 The question of whether procedural fairness was denied the Applicant is to be determined by considering what was put to the Applicant arising out of the conversation as the material matters influencing the decision of the Tribunal in the context of the assessment of the evidence of the Applicant overall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Accordingly, leave is refused to read the affidavit sworn by the Applicant on 13 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">THE RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUES 
 The Process of Reasoning 
 
58 Although ground 1 of the application relied upon a denial of procedural fairness, the primary emphasis of the Applicant in oral and written submissions was directed to contended flaws in the process of reasoning adopted by the R R T. Accordingly, the first question is whether the R R T fell into jurisdictional error by failing to conduct a review of the Respondent's decision and by failing to exercise the statutory jurisdiction, by asking the wrong question or applying an unsound process of reasoning to the determination of whether the Applicant was a person to whom Australia had protection obligations under the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">The Applicant says the R R T properly considered the first element of whether the Applicant is a Ugandan citizen but failed to consider three other elements of the Convention definition of a refugee, namely, that the Applicant:
 
 
 (a) must fear persecution involving serious harm having an official quality in the sense of being official, or officially tolerated or officially uncontrollable by reason of a Convention attribute of the persecuted person
 (b) must fear persecution for a Convention reason of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or for reasons of political opinion; and
 (c) such fear of persecution must be well-founded upon a "real chance" which is not remote or insubstantial or far-fetched even though the possibility of persecution occurring is well below 50%,
 and determine whether those elements were satisfied or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">
 

59 The Applicant says the R R T adopted an unsound process of reasoning by conducting an assessment of the truth of the statements and evidence put by the Applicant to the R R T, then making adverse findings on credibility and then applying those findings to reject the Applicant's evidence and thus find a lack of satisfaction of a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Rather, the R R T ought to have addressed each element of the Convention (and therefore the statutory) criteria and made findings on all facts relevant to each element of the criteria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">60 In other words, the contention is that an examination of the reasoning of the R R T demonstrates that the Tribunal simply applied a reductive process of reasoning reducing all relevant questions to simply one of whether the Applicant could be believed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Thus, the R R T failed to exercise the statutory jurisdiction of review by failing to properly consider each element about which it was required to be satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">61 The argument is not borne out by a proper assessment of the reasoning of the R R T. 
 
62 The Tribunal in undertaking its analytical exercise, first framed the analysis by considering Australia's protection obligations to individuals within the scope of Article 1A(2) of the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">The Tribunal considered the precise elements of the definition and a number of important guiding opinions of the High Court of Australia in the construction and interpretation (and the Tribunal's obligations generally) of Article 1A(2) and important provisions of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">The Tribunal then identified four elements it described as key elements of the Convention definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">Those four key elements were identified as whether the Applicant was outside his country of nationality, whether the Applicant feared persecution involving serious harm, systematic and discriminatory conduct, a threat to life or liberty, significant physical harassment or ill treatment, significant economic hardship and other matters involving a consideration of section 91R(1)(b) and section 91R(2) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">The R R T noted that the High Court has explained that persecution may be directed against a person as an individual or as a member of a group and that persecution must have an official quality in the sense that it is official, or officially tolerated or uncontrollable by the authorities of the country of nationality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">The Tribunal further noted that the threat of harm need not be the product of government policy; it may be enough that the government has failed or is unable to protect the Applicant from persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">The R R T further noted that persecution implies an element of motivation on the part of those effecting the persecution and that individuals are persecuted for something perceived about them or attributed to them by their persecutors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">63 The R R T noted that the persecution which the Applicant fears must be for a Convention reason of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">The Tribunal noted that persecution feared by the Applicant need not be solely attributable to a Convention reason but a multiplicity of reasons will not satisfy the statutory test unless a Convention reason constitutes an essential and significant motivation for the persecution feared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">The R R T further noted that the Applicant's fear of persecution for a Convention reason must be a well-founded fear and explained that notion as one where the Applicant has a genuine fear founded upon a real chance of persecution where there is a real substantial basis for it but not if it is merely assumed or based on mere speculation .</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">The R R T observed that a 'real chance' is one that is not remote or insubstantial or a far-fetched possibility and a person can hold a well-founded fear of persecution even though the possibility of the persecution occurring is "well below 50%".</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">64 The Tribunal further noted that, additionally, the Applicant must be unable or unwilling because of his fear to avail himself of the protection of his country of nationality or be unwilling to return to his country of former habitual residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">65 Whilst it is true that decisions of the R R T often recite a preliminary analysis of these elements in common or similar form, the reasons do not suggest a formulaic application of the elements to the evidence or a failure to appreciate the scope or burden of the elements about which it had to be satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Rather, the Tribunal appreciated that section 36(2) recites as a criterion for a protection visa that the applicant for the visa must be a non-citizen in Australia to whom Australia had protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol .</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">The Tribunal recognised that it was required by section 414 of the Act to "review" the delegate's decision and section 415 conferred upon the R R T the power to exercise all the powers and discretions conferred by the Act upon the decision-maker and that the R R T stood in the shoes of the Minister for the purposes of section 65.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">That section requires the grant of a visa upon satisfaction of the relevant matters and notably the criteria prescribed by the Act and Regulations (section 65(1)(a)(ii)) and the refusal of a visa if not so satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 at [37] Gummow and Hayne JJ observed:
 
 "The satisfaction of the criterion that the applicant is a non-citizen to whom Australia has the relevant protection obligations may include consideration of factual matters but the critical question is whether the determination was irrational, illogical and not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds [Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 at paras [37], [52], [173]; cf at [9] If the decision did display these defects, it will be no answer that the determination was reached in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">However, inadequacy of the material before the decision-maker concerning the attainment of that satisfaction is insufficient in itself to establish jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">" 
 
 

66 The question of whether the adequacy of material before a decision-maker is sufficient to make out the necessary satisfaction on the facts is something about which minds might legitimately differ and as His Honour the Chief Justice observed in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 at [5]:
 
 "To describe reasoning as illogical or unreasonable, or irrational, may merely be an emphatic way of expressing disagreement with it".</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">
 
 
 and at para [9]: 
 
 
 "[T]o describe as irrational a conclusion that a decision-maker is not satisfied of a matter of fact, or a state of affairs, because the decision-maker does not believe the person seeking to create the state of satisfaction, or to describe the process of reasoning leading to such a conclusion as illogical, on judicial review of an administrative decision, might mean no more than that, on the material before the decision-maker, the court would have reached the required state of satisfaction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">
 
 

67 Because the source of the challenge to the decision lies in the constitutional jurisprudence attending section 75(v) of the Constitution and section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), the Applicant must establish an error of law on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Such error may embrace a number of notions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at page 351 [82], McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed: 
 
 "'Jurisdictional error' can thus be seen to embrace a number of different kinds of error, the list of which, in the passage cited from Craig [Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179] is not exhaustive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Those different kinds of error may well overlap .</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">The circumstances of a particular case may permit more than one characterisation of the error identified, for example, as the decision-maker both asking the wrong question and ignoring relevant material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">What is important, however, is that identifying a wrong issue, asking a wrong question, ignoring relevant material or relying on irrelevant material in a way that affects the exercise of the power is to make an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Further, doing so results in the decision-maker exceeding the authority or powers given by the relevant statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">In other words, if an error of those types is made, the decision-maker did not have authority to make the decision that was made; he or she did not have jurisdiction to make it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">Nothing in the Act suggests that the Tribunal has given authority to authoritively determine questions of law or to make a decision otherwise that in accordance with the law".</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">
 
 

68 In this case, the Applicant contends that the R R T failed to ask itself any of the relevant questions other than whether the Applicant was a non-citizen, failed to afford procedural fairness in providing the Applicant with aspects of the conversation with George Ddungu, failed to reach the necessary level of satisfaction by making unsupported findings and reached a decision which was illogical and unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">69 The R R T correctly framed, expressly, the issues which it had to consider in undertaking its review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">The Tribunal elected to consider whether each of those elements were satisfied by embarking upon a detailed forensic assessment of each of the Applicant's claims and his evidence to determine whether it could be satisfied that the Applicant was, at the date of its decision, a person to whom Australia owed protection obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">In undertaking that forensic exercise, the R R T considered all of the background facts recited at [4] to [16].</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">It considered the material before the Respondent's delegate and the answers given by the Applicant to the questions in the protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">It considered the Applicant's submission of 29 January 2004 and the way in which the Applicant framed his claims for protection based upon a Convention ground [18].</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">The R R T considered the Applicant's statutory declaration sworn 1 July 2003 [24] and a document signed by George Ddungu on 7 January 2004 [24] speaking to aspects of the claims made by the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">Because the Applicant had placed great emphasis upon the notion of his capture by LRA rebels and demands made by those rebels, the Tribunal had regard to the question of whether there was consistency between answers given in the protection visa application and oral evidence and statements made about those matters in the course of the proceedings before the R R T. The Tribunal considered the oral evidence of the Applicant [25], the Applicant's clarifying document of 21 February 2004 [26], the observations about capture by the LRA rebels and the forced telephone call to government officials [26], letters written by the LRA rebels on 20 July 2003 and 27 January 2004 [27] and the Applicant's fear of persecution arising out of his capture by the LRA rebels and his forced engagement with government authorities [28], [30], [33], [34], [36] and [39].</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">70 It is clear from the process of reasoning that these matters were considered expressly in the context of an evaluation of the framework elements identified by the R R T [62] to [64].</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">71 The R R T considered the Applicant's claims about the conduct of supporters of President Museveni concerning indiscriminate killing of individuals perceived to be hostile to the government and particularly illustrative of that conduct, the killing of Mugerwa Charles and his three children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">The Tribunal then further considered the consequential fear on the part of the Applicant arising out of the government's failure to appreciate that the Applicant was not truly a member of the LRA rebel group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">72 The Tribunal then sought to elucidate aspects of the claims by speaking directly with [Pastor] George Ddungu [31].</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">That conversation [31] revealed 11 points going to aspects of the allegations or background facts concerning the Applicant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">The discussion with George Ddungu revealed, in the mind of the Tribunal member, a number of inconsistencies and on 27 February 2004 [32] the Tribunal put those matters it considered material to its determination to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">The function of that letter was to provide the Applicant with an opportunity to comment on six relevant matters which were perceived to be relevant to a decision on the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">The Tribunal [33] considered the Applicant's response, his claim of abduction by LRA rebels and forced engagement with government officials [33] and [34].</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">The R R T considered the Applicant's comments concerning the LRA letters of 20 July 2003 and 27 January 2004 and the reassertion of the killing of the three children of Mugerwa Charles [35].</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">73 The conversation by the Tribunal member with George Ddungu [31], the letter to the Applicant [32] and the assessment of the response [33], [34], [35] and [36] was directed to both resolving, in the mind of the Tribunal, apparent inconsistencies and whether the evidence satisfied the framework questions [62] to [64].</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">74 Further matters of inconsistency, in the mind of the Tribunal arose out of the R R T's consideration of aspects of the material put by the Applicant to the High Commission of Australia in applications made on 11 December 2001 and 3 July 2002 [37].</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Those matters went to apparent inconsistencies between the movements of the Applicant in the latter months of 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">These concerns were the subject of a further letter to the Applicant [37] providing the Applicant with an opportunity to clarify those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">75 The Tribunal considered the Applicant's response [38] and in the face of that response a lengthy letter was written to the Applicant [42] putting a series of concerns going to questions such as whether the Applicant was genuinely in hiding as he contended, whether the Applicant was engaged in the field of activities contended for, whether the Applicant was abducted by LRA rebels, whether the Applicant had such a level of engagement in the 2001 presidential elections that he would be perceived to be politically hostile to the government (particularly in conjunction with the forced engagement with government representatives by reason of his capture by LRA rebels) and other matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">76 The reasoning of the R R T suggests that these propositions were put to the Applicant to test the strength of the various contentions of the Applicant as he sought to plot the points on the continuum in establishing each of the framework elements formulated by the R R T. The reasoning suggests strongly that the R R T was not simply reducing its statutory task to one of whether the Applicant could be believed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">The question addressed by the R R T was whether the statutory elements were satisfied by reason of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">77 The Tribunal considered the Applicant's response of 27 May 2004 [43].</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">An assessment of that response reveals that the Tribunal's extensive consideration of the submission [43] is a fair and proper reflection of the response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">78 Having considered all of this evidence, the Tribunal noted that the Respondent principally based his application for protection upon a well-founded fear of persecution arising out of his encounter with the LRA rebels and the consequences of that encounter in terms of the perception the government (and the army) would hold of his political opinions either actual or imputed and its perception of his association with a group hostile to the government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">The forensic analysis of the evidence was designed to lead to a judgment about whether the R R T would be satisfied of such a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">The conclusions [46], [47] and [48] were clearly open to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Those conclusions reflect a thorough rejection of the evidence of the Applicant and his systemic claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">79 A part of that assessment involved a core claim by the Applicant concerning his abduction by the LRA rebels and an assessment of the inferences and conclusions to be drawn from a consideration of all of the Applicant's material and statements made in response to questions in the protection visa application form as compared with the Applicant's statutory declaration sworn 1 July 2003 [24], the Applicant's submission dated 29 January 2004 [25], the Applicant's oral evidence, the Applicant's letter to the R R T dated 21 February 2004 [26], [27], [28], [29] and [30], the Applicant's letter of 11 March 2004 [33], [34] and [35] and the Applicant's submission of 27 May 2004 [43].</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">The conclusions on those matters were open to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">80 In reaching those conclusions, the Tribunal provided the Applicant with an opportunity to make written submissions, provide oral evidence and respond to a specific and focused expression of concern about particular matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">In dealing with the evidence of the Applicant and reaching the conclusions reflected at [46], [47] and [48], the R R T was expressly dealing with the issues identified at [62], [63] and [64].</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">The process of reasoning was not simply a reductive assessment of the credibility of the Applicant but an assessment of whether the evidence established the statutory criteria in the way framed by the R R T which, in turn, necessarily involved an assessment of the truthfulness of the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">In the assessment of the evidence generally, the R R T's view of the credibility of the Applicant was, however, decisive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">The findings demonstrate that the R R T evaluated each of the claims and tested the version given by the Applicant in relation to his alleged abduction by LRA rebels, the consequences of the abduction, the events surrounding the abduction, the obligation to conduct a telephone discussion with government officials, his claim to go into hiding on return to Kampala or Masaka, the claimed harassment by government officials and the explanation as to why the Applicant ultimately did not go to Germany.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">The R R T expressed "general problems" with the Applicant's credibility, described the Applicant's evidence as "completely unreliable" and rejected the Applicant on the matters identified at [48].</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">81 Therefore, on the whole of the evidence, the R R T, for reasons given at length, found the Applicant's version of events completely unreliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">It may be that the Applicant's credibility had been so weakened that no weight redemptive of the poisoned well of credibility could be attributable to his evidence: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 at [49]; McHugh and Gummow JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">However, the R R T undertook a systemic examination of each of the elements about which it had to be satisfied for the purposes of sections 36(2) , 65 , 414 and 415 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">It was open to the R R T to make the findings reflected in the reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">The process of reasoning was sound and not affected by illogicality, unreasonableness or irrationality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">Based upon its assessment of the evidence, it was open to make the findings under challenge by grounds 2 and 3 of the application [50].</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">On the question of the process of reasoning leading to credibility findings, His Honour, Justice McHugh observed in Re The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at [67] :
 
 "In addition, the prosecutor alleges that the Tribunal breached s.430(1) by failing to set out reasons for its finding that the prosecutors claim that members of PLOTE tried to recruit him were 'utterly implausible'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">However, this was essentially a finding as to whether the prosecutor should be believed in his claim --- a finding on credibility which is the function of the primary decision-maker par excellence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">If the primary decision-maker has stated that he or she does not believe a particular witness, no detailed reasons need be given as to why that particular witness was not believed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">The Tribunal must give the reasons for its decisions, not the subset of reasons why it accepted or rejected individual pieces of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">In any event, the reason for the disbelief is apparent in this case from the use of the word 'implausible'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">The disbelief arose from the Tribunal's view that it was inherently unlikely that the events had occurred as alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">" 
 
 

82 The Applicant contends that the R R T fell into the error warned against by the High Court in the Court's reasons in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 and Abebe v Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">As to SGLB , the applicant says that the process of reasoning is one designed for arriving at the best possible understanding of the facts in an inherently imperfect environment and that the process is not one directed to punishing or disadvantaging vulnerable people because they have made false or inconsistent statements or are believed to have done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">As to Abebe , the applicant relies upon the observations of their Honours Gummow and Hayne JJ in observing that inquiring whether a person has a well-founded fear of persecution is attended by very great difficulties and that there is no warrant for the Tribunal adopting some unthinking application of rules of law to a person from a wholly different society coming to a new country in which that person seeks asylum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">83 As to the application of the principles reflected in SGLB , there is no basis for concluding from the reasons of the Tribunal that it sought to punish or disadvantage the Applicant as a vulnerable person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">The Tribunal gave no weight to the matter at [22].</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">The R R T sought to establish to its satisfaction on all the evidence whether the Applicant was a person to whom Australia owed protection obligations within the framework of the case put by the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">As to Abebe , there is no warrant for construing the reasons of the Tribunal as the formulaic unthinking application of procedural or legal rules derivative of an orthodox and stable democracy to a person from a wholly different society who would be likely to be conditioned by behavioural norms appropriate to an entirely different polity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">The R R T sought to forensically determine a basis upon which it either might or might not be satisfied as to the framework issues identified at [62] to [64].</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">84 The Applicant further contended that even if the forensic analysis of the evidence resulting in adverse credibility findings was properly undertaken, there were many other grounds for determining the application in favour of the Applicant which the Tribunal failed to address and upon which no findings were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">The Applicant exhibited a schedule identifying 42 factual contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">No finding was made by the Tribunal on 14 of those contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">As to 24 of these contentions, the Tribunal rejected the contention by disbelieving the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Some examples of factual contentions about which the Tribunal made no finding are these: supporters of President Museveni lobby youth and beat them; government not interested in Bawaga people; Applicant's father killed opposing President Milton Obote when the Applicant was a young boy; children beaten and legs broken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">85 In discharging the duty cast upon the Tribunal in undertaking a review of the decision, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to make a finding on each and every factual contention put to the R R T. The R R T must take the case put to it by the Applicant either articulated by the Applicant or identified upon a proper assessment of the material put to the R R T but not necessarily fully articulated or developed, inquire into the elements of the factual contentions to determine whether the Tribunal might reach the required state of satisfaction, address its statutory mind to the correct inquiry, correctly apply the rules of law including rules of procedural fairness and determine whether the Applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">In discharging that role, it is not necessary to decide each and every factual contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">The Applicant has not demonstrated any error of law on the part of the Tribunal in the treatment of the evidence and the contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">86 The Applicant further contends that the R R T failed to have regard to other important evidence, namely, the evidence of George Ddungu confirming that the Applicant was a church worker in Uganda and had experienced problems with the LRA rebels in the north of the country because of his activities with the church, evidence that should the Applicant return to Uganda he would be killed because of these activities and independent country information (200 pages) evidencing problems faced by church and charity workers in Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">87 As to these matters, the Tribunal expressly had regard to the historical work of the Applicant for the Christ Alive Church in Uganda and forensically examined the claims, work, movement and activity of the Applicant on behalf of the Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">The R R T had regard to the letter signed by George Ddungu on 7 January 2004 [24] and information concerning the activities of the Applicant in the north of Uganda on behalf of the Church [31] and the information provided by the Applicant [38].</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">The Tribunal tested all of these matters to determine whether it could reach the required level of satisfaction on the questions before it recognising that the emphasis in the claim made by the Applicant for a well-founded fear of persecution was persecution from government authorities by reason of a perception of political opinions he might hold hostile to the government and a perception of membership of the LRA rebel group by reason of his engagement with government as a function of his capture by the rebels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">His claim of a well-founded fear of persecution is not based upon his membership of the Christ Alive Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">The claim made in the submission dated 29 January 2004 [18] was based upon actual or imputed political opinion or, alternatively, a perception that the Applicant was a member of a particular group hostile to the government arising out of his association with Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">In any event, the R R T considered the totality of the evidence including the implications of the Applicant's role in the Church and reached a decision open on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">88 As to the independent country information, the R R T did not make findings about or comment upon the independent country information going to the scope of the problems faced by church and charity workers in Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">This is no doubt because an examination of the independent country information does not demonstrate material going to the Applicant's participation within a particular group or the activities of members of a group described as that group comprising those who gave "assistance to and protection of alleged rebel Mugerwa Charles" and those who were involved in a refusal to hand over to the military or government authorities the children of Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">Further, although the independent country information describes the scope of the difficulties faced by charity organisations and church groups in Uganda, the information does not go to the issues put before the R R T as the basis for this Applicant's claim of a well held fear of persecution which relies upon a particular perception on the part of the government arising out of the contentious telephone discussion based upon the contentious capture allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">89 The Applicant further contends that the R R T misdirected itself by treating the information and evidence of George Ddungu with caution and that it was unreasonable for the Tribunal to question George Ddungu's credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">The R R T, in fact, relied upon information put to it by George Ddungu as the basis for testing some of the claims of the Applicant and although the R R T member felt George Ddungu was, in some senses quite naturally, supporting and extending himself in support for the Applicant, the Tribunal simply adopted a cautious approach based upon an apparent inconsistency in George Ddungu's statement concerning his move from Kampala to Masaka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">90 The Applicant further contends that the R R T misdirected itself as to aspects of the original application by describing aspects of the oral evidence as raising new claims when those claims had been raised in the original application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Those claims went to the question of the alleged capture of the Applicant by LRA rebels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">This event and aspects of it were seen by the Tribunal as new in the sense that they were not consistent with the matters raised by the Applicant in the visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">The point seems to be that in the application form the Applicant said that Kony rebels (LRA rebels) abducted two of the Church's youth evangelistic team and released them the next day unhurt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">The rebels apparently said that on the next occasion they would need the leader of the team so that the leader could speak to government officials for them, presumably because the rebels lacked the necessary education.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Subsequently, the Applicant said that he had been captured by rebels with his colleagues, thought he would be taken to Sudan and was subsequently released.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">He later said that he had been captured and was forced into engaging in telephone discussions with government authorities which gave rise to the perception that the Applicant was a participatory member of the LRA rebel group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">As indicated in these reasons [4] to [43] the R R T tested these matters in considerable detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">91 There is no demonstrated error on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">Denial of Procedural Fairness 
 
92 The second question is whether the Applicant was denied procedural fairness arising out of the matters related to the discussion between the Tribunal member and George Ddungu on 26 February 2004 [50].</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">In determining questions of fact on issues before it, the Tribunal was entitled to make an inquiry directly of George Ddungu and seek to put to George Ddungu questions which, in the view of the Tribunal, would be likely to inform its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">The content of the obligation of procedural fairness in the discharge of the statutory function does not require an applicant to be present when the R R T seeks information about a contention or seeks to inform itself about facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">The Act requires the R R T to put to the Applicant in the way that the R R T considers appropriate in all the circumstances, particulars of any information that the R R T considers would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">The Act also requires the R R T to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the Applicant understands why that information is relevant to the review undertaken and invite the Applicant to comment on the information (section 424A).</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">93 On 27 February 2004, the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant [32] and put six matters arising out of the conversation with George Ddungu [31] to him and invited him to comment on the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">The Tribunal expressly said that the six matters, subject to any comments by the Applicant, would be the reason or part of the reason for deciding that the Applicant was not entitled to a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">The R R T did not put every aspect of information gathered by the Tribunal as a result of the discussion with George Ddungu to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">The information reflected at points 7 to 11 [31] may have been contextual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">The Tribunal may have considered the information relevant or irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">If relevant, the Tribunal had a statutory obligation to have regard to the information although ultimately it may not have formed the reason or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">A consideration of the reasons and the conclusions demonstrate that the information noted at points 7 to 11 [31] did not form the reason or a part of the reason [46], [47] and [48] for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">94 Importantly, the Tribunal's duty and power to conduct the review is conditioned upon the Tribunal's observance of the requirements of procedural fairness as a matter of common law not just a question of construction of provisions of the Act : Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 615 per Brennan J; Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 40 per Brennan J; Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 --- 600 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ, 604-605 per Brennan J; Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 591 per Brennan J; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at 99-100 [38] --- [39] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ; Gleeson CJ at 89 [5], Kirby J at 131 [132] and Hayne J 142-143 at 168.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">A failure to provide procedural fairness is an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">Two aspects of procedural fairness require consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">The first is that in the ordinary case where no issue of confidentiality arises, an opportunity should be given to an applicant to deal with adverse information given to the Tribunal that is "credible, relevant and significant" ( Kioa v West ; Brennan J) to the decision to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">The second aspect involves a recognition that information of that kind is likely to create a risk of prejudice, perhaps subconscious, and it is unfair to deny a person whose interests are likely to be affected by the decision, an opportunity to deal with the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">95 A question then is whether the information noted at points 7 to 11 [31] of the Tribunal member's conversation with George Ddungu constituted adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">In Applicant Veal of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2005] HCA 72 (6 December 2005), [' Applicant Veal' ], Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ at [16] observed expressly as matters of general principle:
 
 "As is always the case, what is said in reasons for judgment must be understood in the context of the whole of the reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Examining sentences, or parts of sentences, in isolation from the context is apt to lead to error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">In particular, what Brennan J said about 'information that is credible, relevant and significant' takes its meaning from the point his Honour had made only a few sentences earlier [in his Honour's judgment in Kioa v West] that: '[a]dministrative decision-making is not to be clogged by inquiries into allegations to which the repository of the power would not give credence, or which are not relevant to his decision or which are of little significance to the decision which is to be made' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Moreover, what is meant by 'credible, relevant and significant' must be understood having regard also to the emphasis that his Honour had given earlier in his reasons to the fundamental point that principles of natural justice, or procedural fairness, 'are not concerned with the merits of a particular exercise of power but with the procedure involved that must be observed on its exercise'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">
 
 Because principles of procedural fairness focus upon procedures rather than outcomes , it is evident that they are principles that govern what a decision-maker must do in the course of deciding how the particular power given to the decision-maker is to be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">" 
 
 
 and at [17]:
 
 
 "It follows that what is 'credible, relevant and significant' information must be determined by a decision-maker before the final decision is reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">That determination will affect whether the decision-maker must give an opportunity to the person affected to deal with the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">And that is why Brennan J prefaced his statement about a person being given an opportunity to deal with adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant, by pointing out that there may be information, apparently adverse to the interests of a person, which can and should be put aside from consideration by the decision-maker as not credible, not relevant, or of little or no significance to the decision to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">'Credible, relevant and significant' must therefore be understood as referring to information that cannot be dismissed from further consideration by the decision-maker before making the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">And the decision-maker cannot dismiss information from further consideration unless the information is evidentially not credible, not relevant or of little or no significance to the decision that is to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">References to information that is 'credible, relevant and significant' are not to be understood as depending upon whatever characterisation of the information the decision-maker may later have chosen to apply to the information when expressing reasons for the decision that has been reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">", 
 
 
 and as to subconscious effect and the potential for prejudice at [19]:
 
 
 "As has rightly been said, 'the necessity to disclose such material in order to accord procedural fairness is not based on answering a causal question as to whether the material did in fact play a part in influencing the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">[NIB Health Funds Ltd v Private Health Insurance Administration Council [2002] FCA 40 ; (2002) 115 FCR 561 at 583 [84] per Allsop J].</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">It follows that asking whether ... the Tribunal may have been subconsciously affected by the information distracts attention from the relevant inquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">The relevant inquiry is: what procedures should have been followed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">The relevant inquiry is neither what decision should the decision-maker have made, nor what reasons did the decision-maker give for the conclusions reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">" 
 
 

96 In Applicant Veal , the applicant and his partner applied for protection visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">The Minister's delegate refused the applications and each sought review by the R R T of that refusal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">After the applications had been made but before the R R T had completed its review, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs received an unsolicited but not anonymous letter making allegations against the male applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">The letter alleged the applicant admitted he had been accused of killing a person prominent in the political affairs of the applicant's country of origin (Eritrea) and that the applicant was a supporter of, and working for, the government of Eritera.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">The letter was communicated to the Department on a secret or confidential basis but then provided to the R R T. The R R T affirmed the decisions not to grant protection visas to the applicants and in giving its reasons said that it gave no weight to the letter sent to the Department and forwarded to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">The question was whether nevertheless, the applicant was denied procedural fairness by not being given an opportunity to respond to the letter and whether the letter had a subconscious effect upon the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">97 Their Honours concluded that the alleged admission by the applicant and whether the applicant was working for the government of his country of origin were matters that "bore upon whether he had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason": ( "Applicant Veal" ) [20] and that procedural fairness required the Tribunal to draw the appellant's attention to the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">Their Honours then dealt with important questions of analogical principle concerning "public interest immunity" not relevant in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">98 The Tribunal, in the discharge of its duty is bound to make its own inquiries and form its own views upon the claim made by the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">Information obtained by the Tribunal which is relevant to that inquiry cannot be ignored by the Tribunal nor can the information be put to one side before reaching a conclusion that the application should be refused, in circumstances where the information demonstrates facts and circumstances which would lead the R R T to the conclusion that it could not be satisfied that an applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">99 In this case, the Tribunal made inquiries and obtained information from George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">The information was not communicated anonymously nor was it given in any confidential circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">The reasons demonstrate that the first six points of the note of the discussion contained adverse information affecting the Applicant which was credible, relevant and significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">It was communicated to the Applicant so that he might be provided with an opportunity to deal with the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">Points 7 to 11 in the note [31] were not matters relevant to the decision of the Tribunal or were matters of little significance to the decision to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">The procedure adopted by the Tribunal was to put to the Applicant that body of information which the Tribunal regarded as credible, reliable, reflective of inconsistencies in other evidence of the Applicant (and therefore significant) so as to enable the Applicant to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">100 The Tribunal was not required to put points 7 to 11 of the information [31] obtained from George Ddungu to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">The Applicant's affidavit of 29 June 2005 (paras.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">8 to 21 and exhibits 7 to 11) has been admitted into evidence simply on the ground that the documents reflect those further things that might have been said or put to the R R T had points 7 to 11 been put to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">Since there was no obligation to put those points to the Applicant there was no denial of procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">In any event, the Applicant knew from approximately 27 February 2004 [32] that the Tribunal member's discussion with George Ddungu resulted in important information (points 1 to 6) being provided to the Tribunal, the information was regarded as important and significant and likely to form part of the reason for deciding the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">Whatever contention the Applicant may wish to have put to the R R T, he was able to put it from approximately 27 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">101 The R R T did not fail to afford procedural fairness to the Applicant by failing to address questions to George Ddungu on matters which may or may not have been within his knowledge or upon matters likely to be within his knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">The R R T was entitled to obtain any information from George Ddungu that it considered potentially relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">Nor did the R R T fail to afford procedural fairness by failing to provide the Applicant with a record or transcript of the information provided by George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">The Tribunal may gather information as it considers relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">Some of that information will be relevant and will be considered and evaluated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">Arising out of that consideration, information may form a part of the reason for affirming a decision in which event the R R T has a duty to put that information to the Applicant and invite comment upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">The content of the obligation to provide procedural fairness does not require an applicant be provided with "a transcript of the evidence" [50] gathered by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">In this case, there was no obligation upon the R R T to provide the Applicant with a transcript of the information provided to the R R T by George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">A consideration of the letter dated 27 February 2004 [32] demonstrates that the R R T conveyed the information the Tribunal then considered would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review, to the Applicant in clear and precise terms.</sentence>

 THE APPLICATION 
 
 1 This is an application in the original jurisdiction of the Court by way of an appeal under section 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act ") from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") by which the Tribunal determined that particular documents of the Applicant were not exempt on the contended ground of legal professional privilege, from access to the Respondent pursuant to Part III of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) ("the FOI Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">To avoid any confusion between the Applicant for the documents and the Applicant for relief in these proceedings, I will describe the Applicant in the proceedings as Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">I will describe the Respondent in the proceedings as Ms Foster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">THE BACKGROUND 
 
2 The background facts and relevant statutory provisions are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 Comcare is a body established by sections 68 and 74 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) ("the SRC Act ") and has the functions and powers conferred by sections 69 and 70 among other functions conferred by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">4 Ms Foster made claims upon Comcare for compensation in relation to incapacity and also permanent impairment on 31 March 1999 (Q1999/369) and 13 December 2002 (Q2002/1094) among other claims including an application in November 1994 (Q1994/731) all pursuant to the SRC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">5 On 23 January 2003, the Respondent made an application to Comcare for the provision of copies of documents relating to those claims in these terms:
 
 "I would like to request copies of all my files, computer, email, paper notes etc.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">I would have files in the department with your litigation area, AAT files, section 37 'T' documents, medical files, compensation files, claims for costs (files?</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">) etc.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">I would like a copy of everything thank you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">I last made a FOI/Section 59 request in 1995 so documents made prior to 27/5/1995, unless they were not previously supplied, are not needed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">I do not know whether I was to lodge my request under FOI or Section 59 as I do not know about section 59 but can you please accept whichever will provide me with full access in the most timely manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Can you please also ensure that Kristina King's notes (handwritten by Kristina) of the Conciliation meeting at the AAT in June 2002 and Comcare notes of the Directions Hearing at the AAT at the end of 1998 or 1999 are included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">" 
 
 

6 The reference to section 59 is a reference to section 59 of the SRC Act which, relevantly for these purposes, provides:
 
 " 59 Certain document to be supplied on request 
 
 
 
 
 (1) A relevant authority shall: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) on request by a claimant --- give to the claimant any document held by the authority that relates to the claimant's claim; or 
 
 
 
 ..." 
 
 
 

7 The application for access to the documents (and provision of copies of documents) was made both in accordance with the provisions of Part III of the FOI Act and section 59 of the SRC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">On 23 March 2003, the Respondent made a further request for access to "all my files under the FOI Act ... from the start of my claim" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">That request made reference to another claim or reference number described as "claim 26745/03".</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">On 8 May 2003, Comcare made a decision to release certain documents and withhold "legal advice, internal working documents in relation to legal advice and investigation documents" on the ground that those documents were exempt from disclosure by operation of section 42(1) of the FOI Act because the documents are of such a nature that they would be privileged from production in legal proceedings on the ground of legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">8 Section 42(1) of the FOI Act is in these terms:
 
 " 42 Documents subject to legal professional privilege 
 
 
 
 
 (1) A document is an exempt document if it is of such a nature that it would be privileged from production in legal proceedings on the ground of legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">
 
 ..." 
 
 
 
 

9 In construing the scope of that exemption, section 32 of the FOI Act provides:
 
 " 32 Interpretation 
 
 
 
 A provision of this Part [Part IV --- Exempt documents] by virtue of which documents referred to in the provision are exempt documents: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) shall not be construed as limited in its scope or operation in any way by any other provision of this Part by virtue of which documents are exempt documents; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) shall not be construed as not applying to a particular document by reason that another provision of this Part of a kind mentioned in paragraph (a) also applies to that document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">" 
 
 
 
 

10 On 4 June 2003, Ms Foster requested Comcare to conduct an internal review of that decision and on 30 July 2003 Comcare, having undertaken the review, decided to provide access to and copies of 16 further documents to Ms Foster and refuse access to all the remaining documents previously withheld in reliance upon section 42(1) of the FOI Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Upon review, Comcare concluded the documents were privileged from production on the ground of legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Comcare described the character of the documents as documents which: 
 
 "... are, or record, confidential communications made between Comcare and its lawyers, or confidential documents obtained or prepared for the dominant purpose of Comcare being provided with legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">In some cases, this also included the purpose of preparing for or conducting litigation to which Comcare was a party or litigation being considered by Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Comcare has not waived that legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">" 
 
 

11 Comcare also refused access to all documents contained on Comcare's investigation file (described as 226745/03) on the ground that disclosure of those documents:
 
 
 "(a) ... would disclose matter in the nature of, or relating to, opinion, advice and recommendations for the purposes of deliberative functions of the agency and be contrary to the public interest; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) ... would or would be reasonably likely to prejudice the effectiveness of measures for investigating breaches of the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">" 
 
 
 
 The statutory basis relied upon for each ground of exemption [11] was sections 36(1) and 37 (2)(b) of the FOI Act respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Section 36(1) is in these terms:
 
 
 " 36 Internal working documents 
 
 
 
 
 (1) Subject to this section, a document is an exempt document if it is a document the disclosure of which under this Act: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) would disclose matter in the nature of, or relating to, opinion, advice or recommendation obtained, prepared or recorded, or consultation or deliberation that has taken place, in the course of, or for the purposes of, the deliberative processes involved in the functions of an agency or Minister or of the Government of the Commonwealth; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) would be contrary to the public interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">" 
 
 Section 37(2)(b) is in these terms:
 
 
 
 " 37 Documents affecting enforcement of law and protection of public safety 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) A document is an exempt document if its disclosure under this Act would, or could reasonably be expected to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (b) disclose lawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or dealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law the disclosure of which would, or would be reasonably likely to, prejudice the effectiveness of those methods or procedures; 
 
 
 
 
 ..." 
 
 
 
 

12 Access was refused to some documents in reliance upon section 45 of the FOI Act on the ground that the documents "are or record material obtained by Comcare in confidence and whose disclosure would found an action for breach of confidence" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">However, those documents were documents within the category of group of documents Comcare decided were exempt under section 42(1) of the FOI Act and therefore "no purpose would be served in further identifying these documents" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">13 On 25 August 2003, Ms Foster applied to the Tribunal for a review of Comcare's decision arising out of the internal review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Subsequent to Ms Foster filing her application with the Tribunal, Comcare elected to release further documents to Ms Foster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The documents to which Comcare continues to refuse access are set out in Annexure "KAK1" to the affidavit of Kristina Anne King affirmed on 13 February 2004 and marked Exhibit 1 in the Tribunal review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Kristina King is a public servant employed as an instructing officer in the "Appeals and Review Team" within Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 refers to various documents, among others, generally described as "investigation file" and referenced as E123 and "copies of surveillance videos" referenced E124 and dated 20 July 2000 to 18 August 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">These documents (and particularly E124) are more particularly described in the affidavit of Gary King sworn 13 February 2004 and marked Exhibit 2 in the Tribunal review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">However, a confidentiality order applies to those documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Nevertheless, they are the same documents referred to generally in Annexure "KAK1" to the affidavit of Kristina King.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">A "document" for the purposes of the FOI Act includes, by section 4(1): 
 
 "(a) any of, or any part of any of, the following things: 
 
 ... 
 
 (iv) any article or material from which sounds, images or 
 
 
 
 writings are capable of being reproduced with or without the aid of any other article or device; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (v) any article on which information has been stored or recorded, either mechanically or electronically; 
 
 
 
 
 (vi) any other record of information; or 
 
 (b) any copy, reproduction or duplicate of such a thing; or 
 
 (c) any part of such a copy, reproduction or duplicate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">" 
 
 

14 As to important factual matters concerning the creation and treatment of documents falling within the schedule marked Annexure "KAK1", Kristina King says this:
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I am employed as an instructing officer in the Appeals and Review Team within Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">My role in that position includes management of Comcare's responses to applications to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of decisions made under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 ("the SRC Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Since 1999 I have had responsibility for the management of Comcare's response to 2 applications by the Applicant in this matter to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of decisions made by Comcare in relation to claims by the Applicant for compensation under the SRC Act those applications being Application Q1999/369 lodged 31 March 1999 and Application Q2002/1094 lodged 13 December 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">I am also aware that the Applicant had, prior to my involvement, lodged an earlier application, Q94/731 lodged in November 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Comcare engaged Messrs Phillips Fox, lawyers, to provide legal advice to Comcare in relation to claims by the Applicant under the SRC Act and to provide legal services to Comcare in relation to the proceedings Q1999/369 and Q2002/1094 brought in the AAT by the Applicant as listed above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Annexed hereto and marked KAK-1 is a list of documents in respect of which Comcare claims exemption from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Acct 1982.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Each of the documents listed but not struck through was created either for the dominant purpose of Messrs Phillips Fox giving or Comcare obtaining legal advice in respect of the Applicant's claims for compensation under the SRC Act or her applications to the AAT for review of decisions on such claims or for the dominant purpose of use in existing or anticipated proceedings in the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 
 
 
 
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It is the usual practice when Comcare requests or receives legal advice from external legal service providers that the matter is referred to an appropriate lawyer within that provider firm to prepare and provide the advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">One of the reasons that Comcare seeks legal advice from external legal service providers is to gain independent advice with respect to a particular matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 
 
 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">When legal advice is received from external legal service providers, it is kept separately from the claim file in a white folder specifically utilised for holding documents passing between Comcare and its external service providers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">That folder is retained within the AAT Unit of Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 
 
 
 
 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The same measures are taken when Comcare creates or obtains documents for use in existing or anticipated proceedings in the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Where other litigation proceedings are initiated, similar measures are taken, except that the white AAT folder may be retained in the Legal Services Unit of Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">" 
 
 
 

15 Accordingly, Comcare by reason of the purpose actuating the mind of Comcare's officer, Ms King, claims all the documents listed in Annexure "KAK1" (apart from expressly deleted references --- all further reference to the documents listed in Annexure "KAK1" exclude those documents in the Schedule shown with a line drawn through the particular entry) attract an exemption under the FOI Act (being the primary source of Ms Foster's application) on the ground that those documents (and the video recordings) would be privileged from production in legal proceedings (including proceedings in the performance of the Executive's administrative decision-making upon review in the Tribunal).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The same principle applies to the specifically listed documents in Annexure "GTK1" of Exhibit 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Before the Tribunal, Comcare abandoned the exemption based upon section 45 and conceded that the section 36 ground of exemption added nothing because its operation in the circumstances, turned upon whether the documents were exempt by operation of section 42(1) of the FOI Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In other words, it would be contrary to public interest to disclose documents falling within section 36(1)(a) if any such documents are of such a nature that they would be privileged from production in legal proceedings on the ground of legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">To the extent that any document within Annexure "KAK1" of Exhibit 1 withheld in reliance upon section 42(1) of the FOI Act also comprehended documents falling within section 59 of the SRC Act (and not disclosed), Comcare relied upon the privilege from production on the ground of legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It seems to be common ground between the parties that neither section 59 of the SRC Act nor the SRC Act otherwise expressly or by necessary implication abrogates the privilege from production of documents on the ground of legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">THE DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL 
 
16 On 11 November 2004, the Tribunal set aside the decision arising out of Comcare's internal review and determined that:
 
 
 (a) a number of the documents identified in the Schedule marked Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 [17 (paragraph 25 of the Reasons)] were not exempt for the purposes of section 42 of the FOI Act;
 (b) apart from any document properly attracting legal professional privilege for the purposes of section 42 of the FOI Act , a number of documents identified within Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 could not be characterised as "internal working documents" for the purposes of section 36(1) of the FOI Act and that release of those documents would neither reveal the deliberative processes of Comcare nor be contrary to the public interest; 
 (c) the surveillance videos described at E124 of the Schedule, Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1, related to Ms Foster's claim for compensation, contained personal information about her and were not exempt under either section 36 or section 42 of the FOI Act ; and
 (d) as to investigation reports, the Tribunal upheld exemptions in reliance upon sections 36 and 37 of the FOI Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 

17 As to the question of the exemption under section 42 of the FOI Act , the process of reasoning adopted by the Tribunal was this:
 
 
 "19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">In Baker v Campbell (1983) 49 ALR 385 a majority of the High Court held that the doctrine of legal professional privilege applied not only to judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings but also to situations where there are no anticipated judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 
 
 
 20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">One of the majority (Dawson J) explained the decision at page 445: 
 
 
 
 
 'But the protection which is unquestionably afforded by legal professional privilege in judicial proceedings (in this case criminal proceedings), would be set at nought if by executive or administrative processes revelation of professional confidences could be compelled, particularly if by this means evidence of them might subsequently be given in any subsequent judicial proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It is obvious, to my mind, that any person seeking advice such as must have been sought in this case would be seriously hampered in giving full instructions, as would his legal adviser be in giving advice, by the prospect that the instructions or the advice might have to be disclosed under compulsion and so become available for use, in one way or another, to his disadvantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Clearly, those instructions and the consequent advice would be likely to be relevant in establishing at least the fact of agreement, which is a necessary part of any conspiracy, and the nature of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">And yet, it is just such relevant evidence that the law excludes in judicial proceedings because of its overriding regard for the confidentiality of communications between a legal adviser and his client and it does so at the expense of the availability of the whole of the relevant evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It is hardly to be supposed that the principle which lies behind that exclusion is so narrow in its application as to be confined to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings with the result that it may be thwarted by executive or administrative processes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The decision of the High Court in Waterford v Commonwealth of Australia (1987) 71 ALR 673 put beyond doubt that documents brought into existence for the sole purpose of obtaining and giving and receiving legal advice in relation to proceedings in this Tribunal would sustain a claim for legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">There the Court referred to the sole purpose test (as explained in Grant v Downs (1976) 11 ALR 577).</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">That must now be considered in light of the Court's decision in Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">There the Court overruled Grant v Downs , holding that the test for whether legal professional privilege exists is whether the dominant purpose for which the document came into existence was the purpose of obtaining legal advice and communication of legal advice or information which may be used in existing or possible legal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Of course it is the client's privilege and may be waived by the client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 
 
 
 
 
 22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">In this case the respondent has done so in relation to some documents for which exemption is not claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The following extract from the dissenting judgment of Barwick CJ in Grant v Downs at page 579-80 is the accepted statement of the law relating to legal professional privilege in Australia (and also for the purposes of section 42 of the FOI Act ): 
 
 
 
 
 
 'Having considered the decisions, the writings and the various aspects of the public interest which claim attention, I have come to the conclusion that the court should state the relevant principle as follows: a document which was produced or brought into existence either with the dominant purpose of its author, or of the person or authority under whose direction, whether particular or general, it was produced or brought into existence, of using it or its contents in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation, at the time of its production in reasonable prospect, should be privileged and excluded from inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">
 
 In the application of this principle, the fact that the person who produced, or the person or authority who or which directed the production of the document, had in mind other uses of the document will not preclude that document being accorded privilege, if it were produced with the requisite dominant purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Further, the circumstances that the document is a 'routine document' will not be definitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The dominant purpose of its production may none the less qualify it for professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Whether or not a document does so qualify is a question ultimately to be decided, if need be, upon an inspection by the judge of the document itself, and by the application of the stated principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">An example of a routine document that was held to not be privileged is the solicitor's trust account ledger considered by Connolly J in Re Packer and Others v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1983) 53 ALR 589.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">There his Honour followed the majority in Grant v Downs but the judgment remains instructive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">
 
 
 
 
 
 25.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">I have reviewed all the documents referred to in the schedule to Exhibit 1 in respect of which exemption is claimed under section 42 of the FOI Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">I am satisfied that the claimed documents are exempt pursuant to section 42 except the following documents:

 THE RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUES 
 The Section 42 Exemption 
 
22 Comcare contends that all the documents identified in Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 (including those documents found not exempt for the purposes of section 36 of the FOI Act ) attract the privilege from disclosure on the ground of legal professional privilege and the Tribunal in determining the necessary question of fact concerning the purpose for bringing the challenged material into existence, applied an incorrect test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">In Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at page 70, para [52] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ observed:
 
 "A claim for privilege is not conclusively established by the use of a verbal formula.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">A court has power to examine documents in cases where there is a disputed claim and it should not be hesitant to exercise such a power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">In appropriate cases, there is also a power to allow cross-examination of a deponent of an affidavit claiming privilege"; 
 
 
 and in Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 692, Jacobs J observed: 
 
 
 "I think that the question which the court should pose to itself is this --- does the purpose of supplying the material to the legal adviser account for the existence of the material?</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">I use the word purpose here in the sense of intention --- the intended use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The question is one of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">In some cases, a mere general description of documents in an affidavit of discovery may indicate an affirmative answer without any need further to examine the documents or the circumstances in which they came into existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">In other cases, both an examination of the documents and the surrounding circumstances may be necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">" 
 
 

23 In the proceedings before the Tribunal, Ms King was cross-examined by Ms Foster on aspects of her affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Primarily, Ms Foster's questions were directed to the nature of the documents making up Annexure "KAK1".</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The Tribunal member examined each of the documents identified in Annexure "KAK1" and made a finding of fact that the documents described at paragraph 25 of the Reasons were not prepared for the dominant purpose of Comcare acquiring and Comcare's external independent lawyers, Phillips Fox, providing legal advice nor for the dominant purpose of Comcare being provided with legal services in relation to the proceedings before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Those conclusions are determinations on questions of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">24 The first question is whether in determining that question, the Tribunal applied an incorrect legal test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">25 The Applicant's central argument is simply this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">A proper reading of the Reasons of the Tribunal and particularly paragraph 26 of the Reasons suggest that the Tribunal member reached the finding that the documents described at paragraph 25 were not prepared for the dominant purpose of Comcare acquiring and Phillips Fox providing legal advice nor the provision and acquisition of legal services in connection with the proceedings for the reason that "most of the documents are purely procedural and only refer to information on the public record " .</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The contention is that the final sentence of paragraph 26 is not simply an observational statement but rather an explanation of the deliberative process applied to each of the documents described in paragraph 25 of the Reasons to determine the question of whether the claim for legal professional privilege was made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The Reasons of the Tribunal member do not address, in terms, the evidence of Ms King in detail and particularly the formulation adopted at paragraph 4 of the affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The process, correctly, was to take each of the documents in respect of which a claim for legal professional privilege was made and make an assessment of whether each particular document was, as Ms King claims:
 
 
 (a) created either for the dominant purpose of Messrs Phillips Fox giving or Comcare obtaining legal advice in respect of the Applicant's claims for compensation under the SRC Act or her applications to the AAT for review of decisions on such claims; or
 (b) for the dominant purpose of use in existing or anticipated proceedings in the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">
 

26 In effect, the Tribunal rejected the evidence of Ms King so far as the claim related to those documents described at paragraph 25 of the Reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">In rejecting that evidence, the final sentence of paragraph 26 seems, fairly read, to suggest that the question of whether the documents referred to information on the public record and whether the documents reflected material which was purely procedural was determinative of whether the documents were brought into existence for the relevant dominant purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">27 If so, the test applied by the Tribunal member miscarried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">28 As to the question of information on the public record an example might be this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Suppose a senior officer of a corporation such as a chief executive officer or chief financial officer approaches a solicitor or counsel or both for the purpose of determining whether the corporation might encounter legal obstacles in effecting a merger with another corporation or an acquisition of the shares or assets of another corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">A question would arise as to whether such conduct might involve, for example, a contravention of section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) on the basis that the acquisition would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in a market and if so, what remedial consequences might arise at the suit of the regulator or an affected party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">A lawyer asked to advise on that question, having obtained particular material and oral and written instructions from the corporation's officers, might access the website for each corporation involved and access and print documents from that site dealing with the detailed scope of operations, concentration ratios, market share, asset details, quarterly briefings, description of market influences etc, access the website for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and print a copy of the current merger guidelines, recently posted reasons for informal merger approvals, determinations and other material, access the Australian Stock Exchange website and obtain copies of disclosure statements and releases published to the Exchange, obtain copies of annual reports of each corporation and other briefing statements to funds managers and other publicly available documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">29 All of that material, gathered together by the lawyers for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice to the corporate client, attracts privilege from disclosure on the ground of legal professional privilege notwithstanding that the material gathered for the purpose of critical assessment in forming views about components of the legal questions, is drawn from information on the public record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The client enjoys an immunity from disclosure of the printed versions of electronic material or copies of documents gathered from public databases and registers because disclosure of those documents would reveal confidential communications between the lawyer and the client concerning the seeking and giving of legal advice on the various issues comprehended by the legal questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">30 As to the question of whether the documents, upon examination, reflect purely procedural matters, an assessment of the content of those documents is relevant to the question of whether the document was brought into existence for the asserted dominant purpose when testing the affidavit affirming the facts providing the foundation for the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">However, the content of the document is not determinative of the factual question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">As Barwick CJ observed in Grant v Downs (1976) 11 ALR 577 at 579-580: "The circumstance that the document is a 'routine document' will not be definitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The dominant purpose of its production may nonetheless qualify it for professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Whether or not a document does so qualify is a question ultimately to be decided, if need be, upon an inspection by the judge of the document itself and by the application of the stated principle ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">
 
31 The accepted principles to be applied in the determination of the factual questions are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Although views might differ ( Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Limited &amp; Ors (1996 --- 1997) [1997] HCA 3 ; 188 CLR 501 ( "Propend Finance" ) per Gummow J at page 564) as to whether the privilege is to be characterised as a practical guarantee of fundamental, constitutional or human rights ( Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 490), a substantive rule of law ( Carter v Northmore Hale Davy &amp; Leake [1995] HCA 33 ; (1995) 183 CLR 121 at 161) or a traditional common law right which is not to be abolished or cut down otherwise than by clear statutory provision ( Bropho v Western Australia [1990] HCA 24 ; (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 17-18), it is now clear that legal professional privilege is a rule of substantive law available to a person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents which would reveal communications between a client and his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services, including representation in legal proceedings: The Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543 (" Daniels Corporation" ) at page 552 [9] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">32 Legal professional privilege is not merely a rule of evidence but an important common law immunity not confined to the processes of discovery and inspection or the giving of evidence in judicial proceedings: Daniels Corporation at 552 and 553 [10] and [11]; Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 ( "Esso Australia" ), Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 73 [61].</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">33 The test is "anchored to the purpose for which the document was brought into existence"; Propend Finance per Brennan CJ at page 508 and the privilege "protects the confidentiality of documents produced for the purpose of communication between a potential litigant and the legal adviser and confidentiality facilitates the administration of justice" : Propend Finance per Brennan CJ at page 508.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Although the reasoning in a number of authorities proceeds on a false premise that what is involved is privilege for particular documents rather than communications, ( Propend Finance , per Gummow J at page 569), " communications with one's legal adviser for the [dominant] purpose are privileged from disclosure and this privilege extends to the various components of a communication" : Propend Finance , per Gummow J at page 571.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">34 The determination of whether the privilege or immunity is properly established is "not a question of extracting one or other of what may be numerous documents all of which form part of the privileged communication ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The communication as a whole is protected to foster the confidential relationship in which legal advice is given and received and thereby to advance the respect for an observance of the law" : Propend Finance , per Gummow J at page 571.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">35 Where the communication is constituted by or recorded in a document, the document is merely evidence of the communication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">When privilege is claimed for a document, it is because it records or constitutes a communication prepared, given or received for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or assistance: Esso Australia , per McHugh J, at page 79 [80].</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Further, "it is the purpose of the communication that is decisive, not the purpose in making the document... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">[The] document evidences a privileged communication : Esso Australia per McHugh J at page 80 [81].</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">36 In the joint judgment of Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ in Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 687-688, the adoption of a sole purpose test was in part influenced by a concern that where a multiplicity of purposes existed for the preparation of documents, many routine documents passing between management officers within an agency or corporation would also be provided to internal lawyers for a purpose of obtaining legal advice and that many such routine documents would become privileged "merely because one of their intended destinations was the desk of a lawyer" : Esso Australia at page 67 [43] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In the course of confidential communications between a client and his or her lawyer a number of documents may be generated which objectively might be characterised as routine either in the course of giving or obtaining legal advice or the supply and acquisition of legal services including representation and legal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The question is whether the communications of which the documents are a component, were made for the dominant purpose asserted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">37 Although legal professional privilege has been described as " an ancient doctrine which has assumed a life of its own " ( Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice (supra) per Mason J and Brennan J at page 487), the privilege is based upon encouraging full and frank confidential disclosures between a solicitor and client in order to enhance and assist the administration of justice and therefore the determination of rights and interests according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The antiquity of the importance of the relationship between the legal adviser and client in the administration of justice and the preservation of rights and interests according to law was recognised in Shakespeare's dialogue between the conspirators, Cade and Dick in Henry VI, Part 2 when Dick in response to Cade's description of the tyrannical and discretionary character of life and rights in England under Cade's proposed rule, responded, "The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">38 In the present case, the evidence before the Tribunal was that the documents identified at paragraph 25 of the Reasons of the Tribunal were created for the dominant purpose of Comcare's independent lawyers giving and Comcare obtaining legal advice in respect of the claims by Ms Foster for compensation or her applications to the AAT for review of those claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Alternatively, the dominant purpose involved use of the documents in the existing proceedings or proceedings then anticipated by Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">The evidence was that Comcare had retained independent legal advisers, the point of intersection between Comcare and the independent advisers was Ms King or other officers within the "Appeals and Review Team", that Ms King had administrative responsibility for managing the claims by Ms Foster and Comcare's response to those claims, that Comcare was seeking advice, independent of Comcare, on Ms Foster's claims and Tribunal proceedings and that advice from the independent lawyers is kept physically separate from other material such as administrative material passing between internal officers within Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">39 The question to be determined is not whether the material is routine and thus the evidence of dominant purpose to be rejected but whether, although routine, the material was brought into existence as part of, or evidence of, or components of, confidential communications between Comcare and its lawyers for the dominant purpose of Phillips Fox giving and Comcare obtaining legal advice or the provision and acquisition of legal services including representation in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">If so, the sequence of letters reflected in Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 are all privileged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">40 Accordingly, the decision of the Tribunal in relation to the assessment of whether those documents identified in Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 evidence such a communication should be set aside and the matter referred to the Tribunal for consideration of whether the letters identified at Annexure "KAK1" of Exhibit 1, although reflecting routine or purely procedural matter or information on the public record, are components of a confidential communication between Comcare and its independent lawyers for the dominant purpose asserted in the affidavit of Ms King reflected at [14] and [25] and thus the determination of the factual question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The Surveillance Videos 
 
41 The second question concerns E124 in Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The Tribunal concluded that the surveillance videos identified as Document E124 in Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 relate to a claim by Ms Foster for compensation and to the extent that the surveillance videos contain personal information about Ms Foster, the videos do not constitute an exempt document under section 42 and therefore are not properly the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege (apart from any question of whether an exemption might arise under sections 36 or 37 of the FOI Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Comcare contends that the circumstance that the surveillance videos contain personal information about Ms Foster does not operate to deprive Comcare of the exemption if the surveillance videos were brought into existence for the dominant purpose identified by Ms King at [14] and [25].</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Comcare further contends that Ms King's evidence is supported by paragraph 2 of the affidavit of Gary King, Exhibit 2, to the effect that Comcare directly undertook inquiries itself and engaged private investigators to conduct investigations on factual issues "in preparation for the proceedings in the AAT" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The facts and circumstances deposed to by Gary King were not contradicted before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Documents identified in Annexure "GTK1" to the affidavit of Gary King referred to the commissioning of private investigators to conduct surveillance by video recording in preparation for the Tribunal proceedings [documents 5, 7, 8, 13 to 21, 25, 38 to 40 at pages 56 to 62 of the Appeal Book].</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">42 Ms Foster contends, in reliance upon Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 at 122 - 123 and Propend Finance particularly at pages 515 --- 516 per Dawson J that no privilege can subsist for physical objects other than documents and since the privilege is a function of communications between a lawyer and a client for the relevant dominant purpose, it is the communication which is the subject of the immunity and not the document or thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">In Propend Finance , Dawson J made the observation at page 515 that to say a document is privileged is merely a "shorthand way" of saying that the "communication" constituted by the document is privileged which was an expression of opinion consistent with the view His Honour had expressed in Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 at 122 when his Honour said the privilege attaches only to communications "made for the purpose of giving or receiving advice or for use in existing or anticipated litigation" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">His Honour further said in Propend Finance at page 516 that legal professional privilege does not "protect a document from disclosure as a mere physical object any more than it protects from disclosure any other physical object" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">43 His Honour, in those observations, is not suggesting that a document which is brought into existence for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services including representation in legal proceedings is susceptible to disclosure because the privilege, properly understood, is a function of communications between the lawyer and the client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">As Gummow J observed in Propend Finance at page 517, the privilege derived from communications with one's legal adviser for the relevant dominant purpose "extends to the various components of a communication" and to the extent that a document thus brought into existence is the expression of that communication it becomes the evidence of the communication as McHugh J observed in Esso Australia at page 80 [81].</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The distinction His Honour was drawing was both to identify analytically the proper basis for the subsistence of the privilege and to illustrate the circumstances in which, for example, a document per se is not privileged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">At page 516 of Propend Finance , His Honour observed, after the passage quoted above:
 
 "That is why a document which has been brought into existence otherwise than as a communication between client and legal adviser seeking or giving advice or for use in existing or anticipated litigation does not attract a privilege: it is not a communication which has its origin in that confidential relationship between client and legal adviser that it is the purpose of the privilege to protect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">It is why a document which merely evidences a transaction --- a contract, for example --- which is not a communication seeking or giving legal advice or for use in the conduct of litigation (in the sense that it pre-exists in any actual or anticipated litigation) does not attract legal professional privilege, even if it is subsequently given to the legal adviser for the purpose of seeking advice or for use in litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">" 
 
 

44 In this case, the evidence is the surveillance videos were brought into existence for the dominant purpose of a communication between Comcare and its lawyers for anticipated use in legal proceedings and was confidential between Comcare and the investigator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">45 Ms Foster further relies upon the decision of French J in J-Corp Ltd v Australian Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers (Western Australian Branch) (1992) 38 FCR 452 ( "J-Corp") .</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">In those proceedings, J-Corp Pty Ltd sought injunctive relief and damages against the Australian Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers (Western Australian Branch) (BLF) in respect of alleged contraventions of section 45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Other respondent unions were joined in those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The matter of relevance for present purposes is that the BLF made arrangements for video tape recordings to be made of events which took place at the applicant's Rivervale building site when the BLF and other respondents established a picket line which was said to have the effect of obstructing or hindering the supply of goods and services to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The BLF contended that the video tapes were made in anticipation of and for the purposes of legal proceedings and were thus the subject of legal professional privilege affording an immunity against disclosure of the video tapes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">46 In considering the merits of those contentions and the jurisprudential foundation for the subsistence of legal professional privilege, His Honour at page 457 made these observations:
 
 "The video tapes have, it may be accepted, been brought into existence for the sole purpose of possible litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">
 
 They are in one sense analogous to witness statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">But they are more than that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">
 
 They are real evidence of events which occurred in public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">They were not taken in circumstances to which any confidentiality attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">To attach legal professional privilege to these materials would be to accord excessive respect to the adversarial aspects of litigation and insufficient weight to the objective of determining in litigation the facts in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">To allow inspection of these materials, in my opinion, infringes no public interest and no established category of privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">
 
 Discovery of the tapes has effectively been given by Mr Farrell's affidavit.</sentence>

47 The High Court in 1997, 1999 and 2002 in Propend Finance , Esso Australia and Daniels Corporation established that legal professional privilege, once properly attracted on the facts, is an important substantive right or common law immunity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Its attraction is a function of whether, so far as the surveillance videos are concerned, they are the emanation of communications made for the dominant purpose of giving or retaining legal advice or the provision of legal services including representation in legal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">48 The point of departure between the facts of this case and those reflected in J-Corp lie in the apparent public nature of the recording of the public events surrounding the picket line which prima facie failed to comprehend the necessary quality of confidentiality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">In other words, the material was not gathered as a function of a confidential communication between lawyer and client notwithstanding that the sole purpose for making a video recording of the picket line was for submission of the video to the lawyers for the BLF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">49 In Boyes v Colins (2000) 23 WAR 123, an intermediate Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal of Western Australia, took a different approach to aspects of the reasoning of His Honour in J-Corp .</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">In Boyes v Colins , the respondent was in possession of a surveillance video made of the appellant in relation to claims made by the appellant of certain physical disabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The respondent had caused the video of the appellant to be made for the purposes of the litigation and proposed to rely upon the video at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Ipp J with whom Pidgeon and Wallwork JJ agreed observed that in Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674, Jacobs J had said at page 690, "Communications with one's legal adviser are privileged from disclosure and ... that privilege extends not only to communications actually made but to material prepared for the purpose of communication thereof to the legal adviser" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Thus, material furnished to the solicitor such as a witness statement to assist in contemplated litigation is privileged and on the same basis, the provision of the video film by the photographer to the respondent's solicitor must, consistent with principle, be regarded as a communication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">In any event, in reliance upon a considerable body of authority, Ipp J concluded that legal professional privilege in relation to communications involving representation in actual or threatened legal proceedings does not depend upon information being "communicated".</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">50 The point of departure with the reasoning of His Honour in J-Corp by the Court of Appeal involved the notion that describing the video images as "real evidence" or direct evidence of matters in issue did not assist in determining whether legal professional privilege subsisted in respect of the communication of the video.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The ordinary rules of privilege must apply and in the face of those rules, properly applied according to the proven facts as a matter of common law immunity, there was no "discretionary power" to compel the respondent to disclose the video film and compel waiver of the privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">51 There seems to be no real point of distinction between the principles which should apply to the surveillance videos and witness statements brought into existence for the purposes of litigation of the issues in controversy between parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The privilege once established may involve a number of further considerations including whether the client has waived the privilege directly through intentional disclosure, whether the client has waived the privilege by implication and whether the circumstances are such that the necessary element of confidentiality in communication, such as in the case of J-Corp , is lacking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It may be that His Honour in J-Corp although he was not directly dealing with the question of implied waiver, had in mind some of the notions which influenced that consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">For example, in Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at pages 487 and 488, Mason and Brennan JJ discussed the notion that circumstances might arise where by reason of some conduct on the part of the privilege holder, it becomes unfair to maintain or extend the privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Their Honours observed that the holder of such a privilege should not be able to "abuse it by using it to create an inaccurate perception of the proposed communication" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Similarly, His Honour Deane J observed at page 493 that a person may use privileged material in such a way that it would be unfair for him to assert the immunity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">52 In the circumstances of the present case, the notion that the video material related to a claim for compensation made by Ms Foster and contained personal information about her provides no basis for rejecting what would otherwise be a proper attraction of legal professional privilege on the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Accordingly, the Tribunal in finding that the surveillance videos are not exempt documents for the purpose of section 42 of the FOI Act applied an incorrect test to the operation and application of section 42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">53 Accordingly:
 
 
 (a) the circumstances reflected at paragraphs 1(a), (b) and (c) of [20] do not render legal professional privilege inapplicable to a document or part of a document brought into existence for the dominant purpose of aiding a party in actual or anticipated proceedings in a Court or Administrative Tribunal;
 (b) for the reasons identified at [22] to [39], the Tribunal applied considerations (in determining whether the documents identified in paragraph 25 of the Reasons and paragraphs 38 and 39 of the Reasons attracted legal professional privilege), inconsistent with the correct legal test of whether the documents, although reflecting routine or purely procedural matter or information on the public record, are components of a confidential communication between Comcare and its independent lawyers for the dominant purpose asserted in the affidavit of Ms King reflected at [14] and [25];
 (c) having regard to the considerations applied by the Tribunal reflected in the Reasons, it was not open to the Tribunal to conclude that legal professional privilege did not apply to the documents identified in paragraph 25 of the Reasons and paragraphs 38 and 39 of the Reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">
 

54 The appeal will be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The Tribunal's decision will be set aside and the question of whether the documents listed in paragraph 25 of the Tribunal's Reasons are exempt for the purposes of section 42 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 shall be remitted to the Tribunal for determination according to law.</sentence>

1 On 18 November 2005 I published reasons for judgment in this proceeding; see Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1662.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">On that day the Court ordered the reinstatement of Mr Colin Williams and deferred consideration of penalty and compensation pending the receipt of written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">These reasons for judgment should be read together with the reasons for judgment published on 18 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Penalty 
 
2 The following observations made in the previous judgment are relevant to penalty:
 
 &#8226; Mr Pillen's refusal to accept the existence of a dispute; [16]
 &#8226; The decision to conduct the stop work meeting at the time it was held arose from Mr Pillen's refusal to acknowledge the existence of a dispute; [17]
 &#8226; It would have been more appropriate, notwithstanding the above point, to hold the meeting at lunchtime; [53]
 &#8226; The "overbearing and provocative" manner in which Mr Minniti spoke to Mr Williams; [24]
 &#8226; The different treatment accorded to other employees who had taken strike action but were not disciplined; [29], [43]
 &#8226; The failure to engage the disciplinary code suggested strongly that Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti were keen to be rid of Mr Williams; [37]
 &#8226; That Mr Williams' status as team coordinator did not affect the decision to terminate him; [38], [43]
 &#8226; The breach of s 298K of the Act was blatant and serious; [51], [71]
 &#8226; "ACI desired to be rid of Mr Williams, who it saw as an active shop steward ... who had given it some grief on industrial issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">" [52] 

3 Counsel for ACI submitted that the decision to terminate Mr Williams was made in response to what Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti understood was Mr Williams' conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Counsel also contended that it was action which Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti believed they were entitled to take under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The decision was opportunistic and not premeditated, counsel submitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 Even if it is accepted that the decision was an opportunistic one, it was nonetheless unlawful and, in the circumstances set out in the previous judgment, it constituted a blatant and serious breach of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">I do not accept the submission that the termination of Mr Williams flowed from a failure to appreciate the scope of s 298L(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti are both experienced in industrial relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">They should not have been in any doubt about the illegality of their conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 I reject the contention that Mr Minniti's reaction to Mr Williams' putting the telephone down showed that Mr Minniti was merely reacting to provocation rather than acting in deliberate defiance of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Minniti had the opportunity to put a considered recommendation to Mr Gillholme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The recommendation was not a spur of the moment decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 Mr Williams' failure to hold the meeting at lunchtime should be considered as only a minor mitigating factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">To class it as a major mitigating factor would reward Mr Pillen's even more inappropriate conduct in failing to accept the existence of a dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 I further reject the submission that Mr Williams' status as team co-ordinator was "an ameliorating circumstance".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Such a contention is inconsistent with the reasons for judgment of 18 November 2005, in which the Court found that Mr Williams' status as a team coordinator was not a basis for his termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 I agree with the submission of counsel for ACI that the Court should not take into account the breach of the disciplinary code, in itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">However, as counsel for the Union submitted, adherence to the code may have avoided the situation which ACI now finds itself in as a result of its summary dismissal of Mr Williams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">9 An examination of the relevant facts shows that two senior industrial relations managers, in important roles, made a decision to terminate the employment of an active shop steward, whose industrial representation of the members of the Union working at ACI had displeased them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In the circumstances, a penalty in the high range of those available is appropriate, but for the matters set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">10 I now turn to the other factors relevant to the question of penalty as discussed by Branson J in Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) (1999) 94 IR 231, as foreshadowed at [79] in the previous judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">11 There is no evidence that ACI has previously contravened Pt XA of the Act, or any predecessor provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">That is a mitigating factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">12 Given that Mr Williams has been reinstated and that ACI has been admonished for its conduct in the 18 November 2005 judgment, there are no continuing consequences in respect of ACI's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">13 The protection of industrial freedom of association and, in this case, freedom of representation, has been upheld by the reinstatement order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">14 The maximum penalty available to the Court is 300 penalty units or $33,000, see s 298U(a)(i) of the Act and s 4AA(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">15 Having regard to the totality of the above matters I consider that a mid-range penalty is appropriate and set the penalty at $16,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">16 There is no reason why the penalty should not be paid to the Union; see Finance Section Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1847 at [71] , per Merkel J and s 356(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Compensation 
 
17 The Union does not currently press for an order for the payment of compensation to Mr Williams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Counsel for the Union informed the Court that ACI has, since 18 November 2005, agreed to make adjustments necessary to ensure Mr Williams' financial position is restored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However, counsel noted that the agreement between the parties had not been fully implemented and submitted that the Court should defer consideration of compensation to allow the agreement to be implemented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">18 It is preferable to allow sufficient time to elapse to permit the parties' agreement to take effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I will place the onus on the Union to re-agitate this issue within 28 days of these reasons for judgment, failing which there will be no order made under s 298U(c) concerning compensation and the file will be closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Should the Union wish to re-agitate this issue the Court will convene a directions hearing at 10.15 am on 14 March 2005 to deal with that aspect of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Orders 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Pursuant to s 298U(a)(i) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) a penalty of $16,500 be imposed on the respondent for its contravention of s 298K(1)(a) of the Act for the prohibited reason referred to in s 298L(1)(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">

2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Pursuant to s 356(b) of the Act the penalty be paid to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The applicant have liberty to apply to the Court within 28 days of the date of this order, for an order requiring the respondent to pay to Mr Colin Williams an amount by way of compensation as the Court thinks appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In the event of liberty to apply under Order 3 not being availed of in the time permitted, the Court will make no order for compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">

 The circumstances of the applicants to the present dispute and the nature and implications of their business and operational activities relevant thereto 
 
1 The first applicant, WorldAudio Limited ('WAL'), is a public company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, having approximately 1200 ordinary shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Its principal business is the sale of broadcast airtime to advertisers, per medium of commercial radio broadcasting services, at some 50 locations around Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The second applicant AusCoast Broadcasting Pty Limited ('AusCoast') is a wholly owned subsidiary of WAL and has been since February 2002, when WAL acquired the total AusCoast shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">AusCoast holds a Medium Frequency Narrowband Area Service ('MF NAS') radiocommunications apparatus licence issued under s 100(1) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992 (Cth) ('the Act'), being licence number 1130030 (the '1620 licence').</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Broadly speaking, it is in the nature of a transmitter licence , in contrast to a receiver licence , those being the two types of apparatus licence available under s 97 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In turn, there are several types of transmitter licences provided for by the Act, the 1620 licence being described by the applicants as 'a broadcasting license type'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">A ' broadcasting station ' is defined by s 5 of the Act to mean:
 
 'a transmitter that is operating for the purposes of: 
 
 
 (a) a broadcasting services bands licence; or 
 (b) the provision of a national broadcasting service within the meaning of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 
 
 

2 WorldAudio Communications Pty Limited ('the Broadcaster'), being a further subsidiary of WAL, holds an Australia-wide commercial radio broadcasting licence under s 40 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), being licence No 1170227.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">That legislation does not fall for scrutiny in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The broadcasting services of the Broadcaster are presently transmitted in the Brisbane area by AusCoast under the auspices of the 1620 licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">For convenience, and in line with the applicants' written submissions, those services transmitted in the Brisbane area are hereafter referred to as 'the broadcasting service'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">An independent engineering report prepared for WAL by THL Australia Pty Ltd, said by the applicants to be one of Asia Pacific's leading broadcast engineering groups, was to the effect that the 1620 licence provides a signal of 'superior listening quality' to 1,150,065 persons in the Brisbane area, and of so-called 'acceptable listening quality' to a further 882,596 persons in the Brisbane area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">3 The statutory scheme for licensing the use of spectrum under the Act has been administered by the respondent Australian Communications and Media Authority ('the Authority' or 'ACMA'), and its precursor the Australian Communications Authority, since 1 July 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Prior to that time, the administration of licensing was undertaken by the Spectrum Management Agency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Nothing turns however on those changes in identity of the administering authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The statutory scheme contains provisions, in addition to the issue of apparatus licences, in relation to the duration of apparatus licences (s 103), the general conditions of apparatus licences (s 107), additional conditions of apparatus licences (s 108), changes to conditions of apparatus licences (s 111), the making of guidelines that the Authority is to apply in exercising its powers under sections 107, 108 and 111 (s 112), the suspension or cancellation of apparatus licences (ss 126 and 128 ), the renewal of apparatus licences (s 130) , and the transfer of apparatus licences (ss 131AA and 131AB).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 One of the conditions of the 1620 licence, apparently imposed from the time of its first issue, is that the location of the transmitter be 170 Kingsley Terrace, Manly, being a suburb of Brisbane; that site was referred to in the course of the proceedings as the 'condition site'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">That condition was imposed pursuant to s 107(1)(g) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Other conditions relate to various technical aspects of the radiocommunications transmission authorised by the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In spite of that condition, transmission of the broadcasting service has never occurred in any physically operative sense from that site at Manly, that is, from the condition site, at least for the reason that the condition site is located within an established residential area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The broadcasting service is presently transmitted from a different location in the Brisbane area, being 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa, which is 5.7 kilometres distant from the condition site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">That site at Tingalpa is sometimes referred to in the parties' submissions as the 'current site', in contrast to the 'condition site' at Manly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The effect of the purported decision of the respondent Authority, the subject of the present review application, which was made on 30 June 2005 and affirmed on 18 August 2005, is that AusCoast is not officially authorised to transmit the broadcasting service, or any other radiocommunications service, from the current site, without breaching the locational condition of the 1620 licence referrable to Manly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">That prohibition, if enforced, would apparently mean that the broadcasting service of the Broadcaster must cease to be transmitted in the Brisbane metropolitan area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">So much would occasion substantial loss and damage, both directly and indirectly, as the applicants understandably emphasised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">5 As I have already indicated, there is not, nor has there ever been, any radiocommunications transmitter located at the condition site at Manly, that site being located within a residential area of Brisbane and itself comprising residential premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">When application was originally made by AusCoast for the 1620 licence, it appears that the condition site at Manly was used by AusCoast as the nominal location site for the 1620 licence because of an inability of AusCoast to identify a suitable location elsewhere for transmission of its broadcasting service to Brisbane, pending proper planning for transmission of radio communications under that licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The adoption of that course of purported expediency was said by Mr Thompson, the chief executive officer of WAL, to accord with the then practice of administrative convenience in operation at that time in respect of applications for and adoption of transmitter licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">As I have foreshadowed, that practice was said to allow an applicant for a MF NAS apparatus licence to identify a convenient address for the transmission site referrable to the applicant's licence, pending completion of comprehensive planning for transmission of radiocommunications under the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In fact an application appears to have been made by AusCoast for the change of the transmission site from Manly to another site in the Brisbane locality as far back as 12 November 1996, it being doubtless considered that it would be highly unlikely that the necessary town planning approval could ever be obtained to operate the 1620 licence from within the Manly residential area, owing to the environmental implications that might have ensued to an area of land so zoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">A precedent for that practice was identified by the applicants as the MF NAS apparatus licence for Hobart, which was listed nominally by reference to the site of the Hobart Fire Station, even though such location could not constitute a radiocommunications site in any operational physical sense for radio interference reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">6 On 29 August 2003, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (the 'Minister') issued Australian Communication Authority Direction (MF NAS Transmitter Licences) Direction No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">1 of 2003, the practical effect of which was contended by the applicants to be that the holders of MF NAS apparatus licences, such as AusCoast, would not be permitted to transmit a commercial radio broadcasting service under a licence of that designation, unless the service was provided by 29 August 2004 (ie within one year later).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">7 AusCoast commenced transmission of the subject broadcasting service on 5 November 2003 from the current site at 320 Fleming Street, Tingalpa, in alleged satisfaction of the Minister's direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It appears that the transmission of the subject broadcasting service of AusCoast has thereafter continued unabated from the Tingalpa site, and there further appears to have been no complaint communicated to any of the parties to the proceedings, including the Authority, as to AusCoast's transmission of its broadcasting service from the Tingalpa site having caused any interference to any other radiocommunication transmission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">8 It was the applicants' further case that the current site is an established radiocommunications transmission site, and that its utilisation by AusCoast for that purpose has complied with all relevant town planning, local government and environmental laws, whereas the condition site remains as I have already indicated within a residential area, in relation to which it is highly unlikely any corresponding requisite approvals could ever be obtained in relation thereto; for one matter, there is a block of residential units standing in the immediate vicinity of the Manly transmission site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It was therefore that on 6 August 2004, AusCoast applied to the then relevant authority to change the site condition of the 1620 licence from its nominal location in Manly to its operative broadcasting site at Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In the course of the communications which ensued, the Authority alleged that the broadcasting service being provided, in effect under the auspices of the 1620 licence, was being operated in breach of licence conditions, by virtue of transmission occurring from a site otherwise than that stated in the condition to the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">9 On receipt of that application of 6 August 2004, the Authority responded by fax of 16 August 2004 to the effect that any such variation of the site condition in respect of the 1620 licence was not acceptable, for the reason that it '... would put the station closer to an adjacent [channel] service on 1611kHz at Tingalpa and less than 30km from an adjacent channel service on 1629kHz at Mango Hill ... [and the transmission site] would be closer to a co-channel service at Toowoomba.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">' Of course there existed a degree of artificiality in relation to the expression '... place the transmitter closer...', the placement of the transmitter apparatus being already physically located at Tingalpa, and having never been physically located at Manly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">10 I should perhaps incorporate reference to further terminologies, practices and policies appearing in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">A 'co-channel service' is another service broadcasting at the same frequency whereas an 'adjacent channel service' would be one broadcasting at either of the two frequencies each side of the subject apparatus licence, namely 1611 kHz and 1629 kHz in the present circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The use of the expression 'closer' by the Authority's officer in the fax of 16 August 2005 is a reference to the application of the so-called '30/160 rule' which rule is enumerated in two policy documents of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The first document is a 'Business Operating Procedure' entitled 'Licensing Narrowband Area Service stations' ('NAS BOP') and the second document is a 'policy information paper' entitled 'Apparatus Licensing --- Narrowband Area Service stations' ('NAS PIP').</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In effect, those policies stipulate a minimum separation distance between MF NAS transmitters on co-channel frequencies of 160 kilometres and for adjacent channels of 30 kilometres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Since in the past the enforcement of those minimum separation distances has not always been strict on the part of the Authority (or its predecessors), it has also formulated the 'make it better rule', whereby suggested variations in site location that do not satisfy the '30/160 rule', but which are an improvement on the status quo in terms of the distances between transmission services, may be approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">11 Subsequently by letter dated 5 October 2004 a further Authority communication informed WAL inter alia that its application dated 6 August 2004 to relocate the 1620 licence had 'not been finalised' because '... the site co-ordinates that you provided do not meet, or improve, co-channel separation distances'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Interestingly in the light of the Authority's present submissions, the author of the letter then went on to request 'within one month of today, additional site co-ordinates information and/or details of how [WAL] propose to regularise the operation of [the 1620 licence]', and said that 'this correspondence is to be taken as a request for additional information for the purposes of s 286 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">' That requested information was apparently provided to the Authority by WAL in a letter dated 27 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">By letter of 15 November 2004, the Authority acknowledged WAL's ongoing efforts to resolve its site difficulties, but indicated nevertheless that the broadcasting service was operating 'in breach of licence conditions'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">No express mention was apparently made in that correspondence of 15 November 2004 to WAL's 'application...to relocate [the 1620 licence]', as that application was described in the Authority's earlier letter of 5 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">12 Two file notes authored by respective officers of the Authority evidence telephone discussions apparently undertaken by those same officers of the Authority with Mr Thompson of WAL in late 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In both of those file notes, the Authority's officers claim to have impressed upon Mr Thompson that the Authority 'had already considered the matter [of the variation of the site condition on the 1620 licence]' and had 'arrived at its current position'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">On the second occasion Mr Thompson was apparently invited to make another request in writing, which he duly did by letter dated 13 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">That letter sought both the relocation of the 1620 licence to the Tingalpa site but also the revocation of MF NAS apparatus licence number 1402943 ('the 1611 licence'), which had as its site condition a location also in Tingalpa some 7.5 kilometres away from AusCoast's current transmission site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">13 At this point of the narrative of material circumstances, I would revert back in time to 27 February 1996, being some five months after the issue originally of the 1620 licence to AusCoast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">At that time in 1996, so the applicants pointed out, the 1611 licence was registered in the name of Queensland Hospital Radio Association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The site of the 1611 licence shown in records maintained by the Authority is presently recorded as Bracken Ridge Reservoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Until January 2005, the 1611 licence, that being of course to be distinguished from the applicants' 1620 licence, had a different site location, recorded as being in Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">However by about the commencement of 2005, a change to the present 1611 licence site at Bracken Ridge Reservoir was approved by the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Bracken Ridge Reservoir site is 21063 kilometres distant from the condition site at Manly, and 18.291 kilometres distant from the current site at Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Yet the 1611 licence is inoperative and has never operated, so the applicants maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Those circumstances were raised by the applicants by way of apparent exemplification of at least the alleged elasticity of administration and operation of the Act relevantly to the nomination of site locations of licensees for convenience until an appropriate transmitter site can be found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The fact that the 1611 licence had issued some five months after the 1620 licence was said to be explanatory of the request made by WAL to the Authority for the revocation of the 1611 licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">That request, and the events occasioning it, are not of course directly relevant to the present proceedings, but provides potentially relevant background to the principal case of the applicants to be presented, in the event that the applicants are successful in the present interlocutory dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">14 Further discussions and communications have ensued between WAL and the Authority concerning the possibility of AusCoast continuing to transmit from Tingalpa, in circumstances which nevertheless were described on behalf of the Authority as already involving breach of licence conditions, though pending resolution of what an officer of the Authority described as AusCoast's attempts to acquire another licence located at Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">By letter dated 23 December 2004, the Authority purported to 'reiterate its advice to [WAL] of 26 August 2004 that [the Tingalpa site] is unsuitable because it does not meet co-channel or adjacent channel re-use distances for a number of services...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Next followed a description of the respective services which were said by the Authority to render the request for variation of the site location to involve breach of the Authority's policy on technical requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">There followed on 14 February 2005 a written request from WAL's solicitors to the Authority to make a decision under s 111 of the Act concerning a condition of the 1620 licence, being that the site of that licence be changed from Manly to Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Critical to the present proceedings is the Authority's correspondence of 30 June 2005, which, after describing the relevant policies and expressing the effect of the proposed relocation on separation distances between the transmission under the 1620 licence and those nearby, was relevantly in the following terms:
 
 '...the [Authority] will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the [Act] and vary the licence conditions in the terms proposed by [WAL]... 
 
 [S]ection 111 confers a power on the [Authority] to unilaterally impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In this way, the only "decision" contemplated by the section is one that will some way change the licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">If there is no change to the licence conditions, then for section 111 purposes, no decision has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It follows from this that it is only where the [Authority] decides to impose, revoke or vary conditions that a review can be sought under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 
 In this case the [Authority] has not made a decision to change the licence conditions so a reviewable decision has not been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">' 
 

The first issue arising in the present interlocutory dispute is whether that communication was a decision ... made... under an enactment for the purposes of s 3(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It is that issue which is addressed by these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 

15 WAL subsequently requested reconsideration of the Authority's refusal to vary the licence site condition, doing so purportedly pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">WAL also sought from the Authority a statement of its reasons for decision pursuant to s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Both of those requests were refused by the Authority in correspondence of 18 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In that correspondence, the Authority reiterated its view that 
 
 '...section 111 of the Act confers a power on [the Authority] to impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">[The Authority] has not exercised its power under section 111 to impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">There is therefore no decision under the Act for [the Authority] to reconsider under section 285 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">' 

In respect of WAL's request for a statement of reasons, the Authority said:
 
 'the decision not to vary the licence condition of [the 1620 licence] is not a decision made under the [Act].</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The [ADJR Act] applies to decisions made under an enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">As there has not been any such decision, this request for a statement of reasons is refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">' 
 

16 It is further in issue in the present interlocutory proceedings whether the Authority's refusal to reconsider its decision pursuant to s 285 of the Act, and to provide a statement of reasons for its decision of 30 June 2005, amounted to decision[s] ... made ... under an enactment for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The applicants' reasons for the intervention of curial relief and the nature of the relief sought 
 
17 It is largely in the context I have already described that what the applicants contend to have been the primary decision of the Authority made adversely to the applicants on 30 June 2005, being a decision followed by the Authority's subsequent refusal to reconsider that earlier decision pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act, or to provide reasons for it, have become the subject of an application for review under both the ADJR Act, and contemporaneously also under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (' Judiciary Act ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The applicants' apprehension is that the practical effect of the decisions of the Authority under review is that their present broadcasting service under the auspices of the 1620 licence must cease to be provided to the Brisbane area, there being apparently no other means by which the applicants could cause their subject broadcasting service to be transmitted to the numbers of persons in that area presently reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The implications of any such outcome are apparently considered to be as damaging as they are far reaching to the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">18 The applicants' case was that the maintenance of the status quo in relation to the 1620 licence, is vital to WAL's business involving the sale of broadcast airtime to advertisers, and further that the metropolitan area of Brisbane, as the capital city of Queensland, is a vital part of WAL's radio network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The provision of the subject broadcasting service under the 1620 licence is a key source of the advertising revenue of WAL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">That is because when allocating advertising to radio networks, advertising agencies place significant weight on the ability of a network to reach audiences in the three major Eastern seaboard capital cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Accordingly if WAL is unable to continue to provide a radio network which covers each of those cities, it will be seriously disadvantaged financially when competing in the national radio market, being a market presently embracing at least those three capital cities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It was asserted that WAL's reputation as a reliable provider of national commercial radio would therefore also be greatly damaged, with a consequentially adverse impact on all remaining markets in which it presently operates, and therefore on its revenues, share price and returns to shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">19 The Authority's decision primarily the subject of the present application for review, as I have foreshadowed, was communicated to the applicants by letter dated 30 June 2005, being a decision by the Authority not to vary a condition of the 1620 licence by providing that instead of the site of transmission remaining nominally at 170 Kingsley Terrace, Manly, the current site of actual transmission at 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa be authorised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">That nominated site relocation was not entertained because it was said not to meet the Authority's policy relating to separation distances between transmitters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">That refusal of site relocation decision, according to the applicants, was made pursuant to s 111 of the Act; however the Authority did not so characterise the same, and hence the Authority did not issue a s 287 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">20 Included within the challenge of that decision of 30 June 2005, and hence the subject further of the present administrative review proceedings, are also what the applicants term the Authority's subsequent decisions, each made on 18 August 2005, being not to reconsider its first decision pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act, and also to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons for that first decision pursuant to s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The Authority adopted the position that no decision the subject of challenge had been made by it under an enactment, notwithstanding, as the applicants would insist, that a decision of the Authority exercising the discretion conferred by s 111 of the Act would constitute such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">21 The basis provided by the applicants in their amended application for being 'aggrieved' by the three respective decisions referred to above, within the meaning of s 5(1) of the ADJR Act, were outlined as follows: 
 
 
 (i) AusCoast is a wholly owned subsidiary of WAL and the holder of the 1620 licence; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) by letter dated 14 February 2005, WAL requested that the site of the 1620 licence be changed from the Manly site to the Tingalpa site; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the Authority 'claims that no decision has been made under an enactment and has refused to reconsider the First Decision [ie communicated on 30 June 2005] or to provide a statement of reasons as sought by [WAL].</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">' 
 
 
 

22 The grounds for the applicants' review application were fourfold as follows:
 
 
 (i) the first decision of the Authority on 30 June 2005 involved one or more errors of law, in that: 
 

(a) the Authority misconstrued the NAS PIP Policy (being the policy embodying the so-called '30/160 rule' and the 'make it better rule') by applying the same as if it had the force of law; 
 
(b) the first decision was made in accordance with that policy, being a published policy of the Authority, and was based primarily on the reduction in distance between another radiocommunications transmission site at Mango Hill (apparently conducted by Proma Radio) and the Tingalpa site from 30.7 kilometres to 29.6 kilometres; so much was said by the applicants to involve 'an overly rigid application of the policy, which is a policy and not a statutory rule';
 
 
 (ii) the making of the first decision on 30 June 2005 was an improper exercise of the power conferred by s 111 of the Act, in pursuance of which it was purported to be made, in that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the Authority failed to take relevant considerations into account in the exercise of the power, namely the considerations set out in WAL's request for the site of the licence to be changed from Manly to Tingalpa; 
 (b) the Authority exercised its discretionary power in accordance with a rule of policy without regard to the merits of the particular case; 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the second decision, being the Authority's refusal to reconsider its decision of 30 June 2005, involved an error of law, in that the Authority misconstrued ss 111, 285(f) and 285(g) of the Act;
 (iv) the third decision involved an error of law, in that having regard to the proper construction of ss 111, 285(f) and 285(g) of the Act, the Authority was obliged under s 13 of the ADJR Act to provide WAL with a statement of reasons under that provision in respect of the first decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">
 

23 Those above respective provisions of the Act (of course being the Radiocommunications Act 1992 (Cth) earlier referred to) read, so far as presently material, as follows:
 
 '111 Changes to licence conditions 
 
 
 
 (i) The ACMA may, by notice in writing given to the licensee of an apparatus licence: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) impose one or more further conditions to which the licence is subject; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) revoke or vary any condition imposed under paragraph (a); or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) revoke or vary any condition specified under paragraph 107(1)(g) ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) if the licence is a transmitter licence, other than a licence issued under section 101A , 102 or 102A or a datacasting transmitter licence --- vary a condition of the kind referred to in paragraph 108(2)(a), (b) or (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">' 
 
 
 
 

(I would mention that s 107 relates to general conditions of an apparatus licence, s 108 to additional conditions for transmitter licences, and ss 101A , 102 and 102A to transmitter licences for particular broadcasting services).</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">
 
 '285 Decisions that may be subject to reconsideration by the ACMA 
 
 
 
 An application may be made to the ACMA for reconsideration of any of the following decisions: 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (f) inclusion of conditions in an apparatus licence under paragraph 107 (1)(g) ...; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (g) a decision under section 111 concerning the conditions of an apparatus licence;'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 
 
 
 

24 It is appropriate to set out also the text of paragraphs 107(1)(a), (f) and (g):
 
 '107 General conditions 
 
 
 
 (1) An apparatus licence is subject to the following conditions: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a condition that the licensee, and any person authorised by the licensee to operate a radiocommunications device under the licence, must comply with this Act; 
 
 ... 
 
 (f) such conditions (if any) as the ACMA may determine, by written instrument, in relation to that particular type of apparatus licence; 
 
 (g) such other conditions as are specified in the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 ...' 
 
 The Authority's objections to competency and the applicants' contentions in support of competency 
 
25 On 31 August 2005, the Authority filed an amended notice of objection to competency which asserted that the Court lacked jurisdiction to try the application for review brought under the ADJR Act and under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , on the grounds that the decision purportedly the subject of the proceedings is not a decision made under an enactment nor a matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The amended notice of objection to competency went on to state '[i]n the alternative if the court determines that it has jurisdiction there is no proper basis upon which to grant relief to the applicant[s]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The Authority described this as its 'related alternative motion'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">26 As I have foreshadowed, in support of its objection to competency, in relation to the operation of the ADJR Act in the present circumstances outlined by the applicants, the Authority characterised its decision of 30 June 2005 adversely to the applicants, not as a decision to refuse to change the subject site condition for the 1620 licence of the applicants, but rather as a prior decision to decline to consider whether or not the site condition may be varied at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It was largely upon that footing that the Authority contended that the initial or prior decision of 30 June 2005 was not a decision made under an enactment, even though a decision involving the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 111 of the Act would seemingly constitute such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The applicants rejoined to the effect that even if that purported distinction was to be taken at face value, the very notion that any such so-called initial or prior decision did not constitute a decision made under the Act immediately encounters forensic and conceptual difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The Authority also submitted that the lawfulness of such initial or prior decision was not a ' matter ... arising under any laws made by the Parliament ...' (see s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act ), since it was made under a non-legislative policy, being the subject of the NAS PIP and NAS BOP policy documents referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">27 The meaning and implications of the statutory notion of 'decision', where used in the ADJR Act, was comprehensively explained by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It was emphasised by Mason CJ at 335 (with whose reasons Brennan J agreed, as did Deane J other than in relation to a particular matter not here material) that such meaning must be determined by reference to the text, scope and purpose of the legislation, and further that the remedial nature of the ADJR Act indicates that no narrow view is to be taken of the notion of 'decision' in that statutory context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Moreover his Honour pointed out at 336 that the concept of 'a reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorises, rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision', and further that 'the examples of a decision listed in the extended definition contained in s 3(2) [of the ADJR Act] are also indicative of a decision having the character or quality of finality, [being] an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application, inquiry or dispute ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Section 3(3) of the ADJR Act, which extends the statutory definition of 'decision' to '... the making of a report or recommendation before a decision is made in the exercise of a power ', was said by his Honour to operate to '... qualif[y] the characteristic of finality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Moreover the Chief Justice explained that '... acts done preparatory to the making of a "decision" are not to be regarded as constituting "decisions" for, if they were, there would be little, if any, point in providing for judicial review of "conduct" as well as of a "decision".</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">'
 
28 In the further course of his reasons for judgment in Bond at 337, Mason CJ pointed out that '... a reviewable "decision" is one for which provision is made by or under a statute', which '... will generally, but not always, entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration', so long of course '... that it be a substantive determination', as opposed to 'procedural determinations'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">29 The applicants focused those explanations and expositions of the Chief Justice upon s 111 of the Act, which refers to power conferred upon the Authority inter alia to revoke or vary any condition of a licence which it may have previously imposed, and submitted that so much did not mean that a refusal to exercise any such positive power on the part of the Authority did not constitute a decision made under s 111.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">It was pointed out in that regard, in my opinion rightly, that there are many statutes in which the decision-making power is expressed only in terms of a positive discretion, without express reference to the power to make a decision of a negative character, yet in such cases it is necessarily implicit that a negative decision would also be made under that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Otherwise, so it was further emphasised by the present applicants, paras (a), (b) and (g) of s 3(2) of the ADJR Act would be otiose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Those subsections read as follows (the emphasis appearing in non-italics is mine):
 
 's 3(2) In this Act, a reference to the making of a decision includes a reference to: 
 
 
 
 (a) making, suspending, revoking or refusing to make an order, award or determination; 
 (b) giving, suspending, revoking or refusing to give a certificate, direction, approval, consent or permission; 
 
 
 ... 
 (g) doing or refusing to do any other act or thing...' 
 

30 In that context of the applicants' discussion of general principles and their operation, I was then referred to the decision of a Full Federal Court in Right to Life Association (NSW) Inc v Secretary, Department of Human Services and Health (1995) 56 FCR 50, where it was held by Lockhart and Beaumont JJ that a decision by the Secretary not to direct that clinical trials of a drug be stopped was a reviewable decision for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The provision in issue was item 3(e) of Schedule 5A of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 (Cth), that item being one of a number of conditions to be satisfied for exemption of the drug from the operation of Part 3 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth), which condition read as follows:
 
 '(e) the Secretary must not, at any time: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) have become aware that to conduct or continue the trial would be contrary to the public interest; and 
 
 (ii) have directed that the trial not be conducted, or be stopped ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 
 
 

The appellant Association had requested the Secretary to stop the trials on the ground that they amounted to a breach of NSW and Victorian criminal law, and were thus ' contrary to the public interest '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The Secretary had then notified the appellant Association and advised that on the evidence available, 'nothing would warrant my acting to stop the trials'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">At 62, Lockhart J observed in relation to that notification as follows:
 
 
 'If the Secretary has reached the opposite conclusion, namely, that to continue the trials would be contrary to the public interest and that a direction should be given to stop them, and thereupon gave that direction, surely that must be a reviewable decision under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The sponsor [of the trial] would clearly be a person aggrieved and would in my view be entitled to such a review of the decision under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Why should the position be different if the Secretary reaches the opposite conclusion, as he did in this case ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">It was a decision which had "the character or quality of finality"; it was an ultimate or operative decision ...' 
 

Beaumont J, who reached the same decision as Lockhart J, pointed out at 80 that '... the definition of "decision" in s 3(1) of the ADJR Act is not confined to those cases where a duty to make a decision is imposed ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Although he reached a different outcome to the majority, Gummow J's observations at 88 are I think also apposite for consideration in the present circumstances:
 
 
 'It was submitted for the Secretary that s 5(1) of the ADJR Act would be attracted only if conferral of the power to give the direction carried with it a duty upon the Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It was then submitted that in the case of condition (e) there was no such duty ... 
 
 The submission, in essence, would limit the operation of s 5 of the ADJR Act to decisions in respect of which there was a public duty, performance of which might be required by a writ of mandamus ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">This would be contrary to the scheme of the legislation ...' 
 

31 The Authority sought to deny any conclusion as to the existence of a justiciable decision by characterising its first decision as declining to even consider the exercise of any discretion under s 111 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">In the applicants' submission that purported characterisation was misconceived, and must be rejected, for the following reasons:
 
 
 (i) the decision not to exercise its power under s 111 to vary a condition of the licence was indeed final, operative and determinative, in the practical sense described in Bond and in Right to Life [cedilla] of AusCoast's ability to continue to broadcast under the auspices of the 1620 licence from the current site at Tingalpa;
 
 (ii) any such characterisation sits at least uncomfortably with the terms of the Authority's letter of 30 June 2005, containing as it does the assertion '[a]s a result the [Authority] will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the [Act] and vary licence conditions in the terms proposed by [WAL]'; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the decision not to exercise the power was one which was authorised by and therefore made under s 111 of the Act, since s 111 confers a discretionary power, and hence contemplates that a decision whether or not to exercise that discretion could be made, there being no other source of power for such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">
 
 
 

I think that there is force in each of the foregoing submissions of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">
 

32 The Authority did not dispute that a refusal to exercise a power may constitute a decision...made...under an enactment , for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Nevertheless it sought to distinguish Right to Life on the basis that in the circumstances of that case, as opposed to the present case, the decision-maker had purported to consider 'the full gamut...of all the relevant issues'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The Authority's contention was that its officer in this instance had in effect 'terminated the request [made by WAL for a variation in the site condition of the 1620 licence] at the first hurdle', without considering all of the issues that the Authority would normally take into account in assessing a variation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">I am not persuaded that such contention of the Authority is sound, and that there is in any event any viable difference between the circumstances relevantly in Right to Life and those here prevailing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">In both instances the decision-maker received a request for a decision to be made to a certain effect, and in both instances there was no provision made under the relevant legislation for such requests to be made by formal application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Moreover in both cases, detailed reasons for that request were given by the entity in favour of the decision it sought to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Most importantly for the outcome of this objection to competency, it was put by the applicants that the refusal of the Authority to make a decision in the terms requested by WAL had the practical effect of constituting an ultimate or operative decision, and hence one which bore the character of finality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The applicants' contentions in relation to what it termed the Authority's second decision made on 18 August 2005 
 
33 It becomes necessary to consider next the implications of the Authority's so-called 'second decision', being that said by the applicants to have been made on 18 August 2005 not to reconsider its first decision of 30 June 2005, to the effect that it would not exercise its discretionary statutory power to alter the condition on the 1620 licence so as to change the site of the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The Authority's objection to the Court's competency to review the second decision rested however on its objection to competency of review of the first decision, and was therefore said by the applicants to encounter the same or similar difficulties which I have already described in relation to the first decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The applicants contended that '[t]he plain words of para 285(g) [of the Act] also tell against the [Authority]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">34 The opening words to s 285, which I have of course already extracted, but nevertheless merit further emphasis, are that ' [a]n application may be made to [the Authority] for reconsideration of any of the following decisions ', the notion of reconsideration being of wide import.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Moreover the ensuing language of sub-paragraph (g) includes the word concerning , which was also said by the applicants to be of wide import, such that there could be no contextual reason to construe s 285(g) narrowly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Hence the applicants contended on that basis that the Authority's decision not to vary the site condition at the centre of the disputation was clearly a decision concerning the conditions of the 1620 licence, that licence being of course an apparatus licence .</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">35 It was submitted by the applicants moreover that the wording of s 285(g) of the Act should be compared with other sub-paragraphs of s 285.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">I was referred again to s 285(f) which explicitly refers to the inclusion of conditions in an apparatus licence under paragraph 107(1)(g) ...' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">So much was said by the applicants 'clearly' to exclude review of a negative decision, that is to say, a decision not to includ[e] the operation of any conditions in an apparatus licence under s 107(1)(g), which statutory expression is used in marked contrast to what appears in s 285(g), which was described by the applicants as covering 'both positive and negative decisions' by reason of its use in particular of the broad notion of concerning .</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">36 It was further submitted by the applicants that if s 285(g) of the Act was intended to be limited to decisions to give a notice under s 111, the Legislature would have used an expression such as that used in s 285(qa), namely decisions giving a notice .</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The point was said moreover to be made even more starkly when other sections of the Act are considered, such as s 118, which by para (a) of subs (1) thereof refers to 'a notice under section 111 relating to changes in licence conditions ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The applicants submitted that it would have been a simple matter for the draftsperson to have used that expression in s 285(g) of the Act, had so much been the legislative intention, and further that the difference in expression provided an indication that para 285(g) has a wider operation than the phrase used in s 118(1)(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">There is considerable force in those submissions of the applicants upon the statutory texts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Outline of the Authority's submissions in support of its objection to competency 
 
37 The Authority's principal contention was that the Act did not impose any duty upon it to consider or act upon requests made by licensees or others to vary the conditions of apparatus licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Instead s 111 of the Act reposed in the Authority a discretionary power to unilaterally vary or revoke conditions of apparatus licences, and s 111 did not provide for a means whereby a licensee could move the Authority to exercise its power under that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The Act was said by the Authority to draw 'a clear distinction' between 'powers in respect of which an application may be made and is necessary and those where no provision is made for an application from an interested person'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">I was referred in that regard to s 286 of the Act, which was said to evidence the former situation, that section reading as follows:
 
 
 's 286 Deadlines for reaching certain decisions 
 
 (1) If this Act provides for a person to make an application to the ACMA for such a decision, the ACMA must make the decision: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) within 90 days after receiving the application; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if the ACMA has, within those 90 days, given the applicant a written request for further information about the application --- within 90 days after receiving that further information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">' 
 
 
 
 

Subsection (2) provides for a deemed refusal by the Authority, if it has not informed an applicant of its decision within 90 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Where any such application procedure is invoked, it was acknowledged by the Authority that it '... is under a duty to consider the application and indeed, must do so within a prescribed timeframe'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">
 

38 Section 286 appears in Part 5.6 of the Act entitled 'Review of decisions' and follows s 285, which provides for the making of applications to the Authority for reconsideration of the decisions listed in that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Bearing in mind the location of s 286 within Part 5.6 of the Act, the meaning of ' application...for such a decision ' in s 286 must be read as a reference to an application to the Authority for a reconsideration under s 285, and not as a reference generally to any decision of the Authority under the Act for which application can be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In any event, the absence of any such express 'application procedures' under the Act for the making by the Authority of decisions under s 111 was said by the Authority to imply that it lacked a duty to consider any request or application purportedly made by a licensee under s 111.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">I observe that the Authority did not draw the Court's attention to any species of decision under the Act for which an application procedure exists other than to applications for reconsideration of the decisions listed in s 285.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">39 The Authority next contended that where no application procedure is provided for, as was said to be the case with decisions made under s 111, the Authority may have a discretionary power that can be exercised, such as its power to vary conditions under s 111, but that the Authority would be under no duty to exercise that power, or even to consider whether or not to exercise that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Reference was made to two Full Federal Court authorities relating to the operation of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (' Migration Act '), as exemplifications of what was said to be a general principle that the mere existence of a discretionary power does not carry with it a duty to exercise the power, or even to consider whether or not to exercise the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">40 It is convenient to consider immediately whether either of those authorities do exemplify or otherwise lend support to that contention of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">WAGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 227 was concerned with the operation of s 427(1)(d) of the Migration Act , which provided that the Refugee Review Tribunal ('RRT') '... may require the Secretary to arrange for the making of any investigation ... that the Tribunal thinks necessary with respect to the review .</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">' The Full Court in WAGJ (Heerey, RD Nicholson and Mansfield JJ) held that s 427(1)(d) did not impose a duty upon the RRT to consider whether to exercise that power to order an investigation, their Honours placing emphasis upon such statutory words may and Tribunal thinks necessary .</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">I would observe that the Court in WAGJ did not purport to lay down any general principle or rule, their Honours' decision apparently being predicated on the above emphasised words in s 427(1)(d) , and the prevailing legislative context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The issue arising relevantly in the second of those decisions relied upon by the Authority, being WAJQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 79 , was not concerned with any particular provision of the Migration Act at all, the appellant in that litigation contending that the Tribunal had erred by failing to enquire into the veracity of certain documents and correspondence provided by the appellant in support of his application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">It is not apparent that the appellant in WAJQ formulated his case by reference to the operation of s 427(1)(d) of that legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The Full Court cited WAGJ as authority for the wider proposition that there is no duty on the RRT to make inquiries, the failure to carry out whereof would give rise to judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">41 I am unable to obtain sufficient assistance from resort to authorities arising in the context of the Migration Act , which has its own terms and conditions for administrative review far removed from those contained in the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Leaving aside contextual statutory differences, WAGJ and WAJQ do not purport to lay down any principle of general application to the effect that the existence of a discretionary power does not impute a duty to consider whether or not to exercise it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Nor was either of WAGJ or WAJQ concerned with the meaning of ' decision ... made ... under an enactment ', as that expression appears in the ADJR Act, or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">42 It was the Authority's further contention that its officers paid due regard to policy formulated by the Authority concerning the location of MF NAS transmitters, and took the view, as they were said by the Authority to be entitled to do, that the proposed relocation advanced by the applicants did not meet the policy requirements apparent in the so-called '30/160 rule', or the 'make it a better rule' apparent in the NAS PIP policy, and that as a consequence, it was decided by the Authority that the applicants' proposal should not be further entertained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The circumstances of the present case were said by the Authority in that context to be 'broadly analogous' to those considered in a joint judgment of a Full Federal Court (comprising Black CJ, Kiefel and Emmett JJ) in Bedlington v Chong (1998) 87 FCR 75, which was concerned with the operation of ss 48A and 48B of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The Authority relied upon Bedlington for the proposition that it is open to a decision-maker, who is under no duty to consider exercising a discretionary power, to draft a policy which identifies the types of cases in which the exercise of that discretion might be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">43 Again I am unable to obtain sufficient assistance from resort to authorities involving the application and operation of the Migration Act , which in the case of Bedlington explicitly stipulated that ' the Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the [power] ... in any ... circumstances '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The Full Court emphasised at 78 of its reasons for judgment that the particular language of subsection 48B(6) was the sole basis for their decision that the Minister was under no duty in any circumstances to exercise the relevant power under s 48B(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">The critical issue arising was whether the Departmental Secretary was under a duty to bring the application made for the exercise of the power under s 48B(1) to the Minister's attention in order that the Minister could personally determine whether or not to exercise that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Their Honours held that the use of policy guidelines by the Secretary as the basis for refusing to bring the application to the Minister's attention, where such guidelines were specifically intended to identify those cases in which the Minister might consider the exercise of his or her power was valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">I have considerable difficulty in discerning the availability of assistance from that further authority, given that it relevantly involved a power that the provision required be exercised personally by the Minister, and concerned only the proposition that the Minister had no statutory obligation to make a decision, and again did not occur in an ADJR Act context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Moreover there is no express provision in the Act (ie the legislation the subject of the present proceedings) to the effect that the Authority need not make any relevant decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">All that discourse put forward by the Authority here in relation to migration cases, in any event, ultimately still begs the question as to whether a decision not to make a decision in a particular context nevertheless constitutes a decision ... made... under an enactment within s 5 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Taken to their logical conclusion, the Authority's submissions appear moreover to run contrary to the warning issued by Gummow J in Right to Life , which I have extracted above, to the effect that limiting the scope of the ADJR Act to decisions in respect of which there was a duty, performance of which might be required by a writ of mandamus would be contrary to the scheme of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">In that latter regard, I would refer again to the text of s 3(2) of the ADJR Act earlier extracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">44 In further support of the contention that a decision by an officer to the effect that a request does not fall within an established policy as to which decisions will or will not be entertained, is not a decision...made...under an enactment , the Authority referred me to two additional decisions of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The first was Brownsville Nominees Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 169, where Northrop J held that the Commissioner's refusal to issue an amended assessment under s 170 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) was not subject to review under s 7 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Section 7(1) of the ADJR Act provides for the making of applications for review of the failure of a decision-maker to make a decision where, inter alia , that decision-maker has a duty to make a decision to which [the ADJR Act] applies .</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Northrop J held at 173 of his reasons for judgment that s 170 did not impose any duty on the Commissioner to make an amended assessment of income tax upon the request of a taxpayer, and thus the application for review of the Commissioner's refusal to issue the amended assessment was not competent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">I would observe that the Commissioner's refusal to issue an amended assessment was expressed to the taxpayer in that case in the following terms (at 171):
 
 '...In the circumstances your request to have the subject assessments amended should remain in abeyance pending resolution of the appeal...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">
 

Of course the issue thus arising fell for consideration in the context of the complexity of the code of that legislation as to the circumstances where an amendment to an assessment may be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Brownsville Nominees did not involve the situation of a successful challenge to an assessment of tax by the Australian Tax Office made by a taxpayer, whether formally or informally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The Authority contended nevertheless that there was no practical difference between that situation and the present, the Authority simply deciding here not to consider the request for a variation at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">
 

45 It is important to bear in mind, in any event, that the applicants have applied for review of the Authority's decision here under s 5(1) of the ADJR Act, and not under s 7 thereof, so that the only question with which I am presently concerned is whether or not the subject decision fulfilled the requirements of s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">In that context I would observe what Lockhart J said at 62 of his reasons for judgment in Right to Life concerning Brownsville Nominees :
 
 'We were referred by counsel for the Secretary to the judgment of Northrop J in [ Brownsville Nominees ] as authority for the proposition that there was no "decision" within the meaning of s 5 of the ADJR Act because there was no duty imposed on the Secretary to make such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Brownsville is not authority for that proposition...His Honour's decision was based squarely upon the duties imposed upon the Commissioner under the Assessment Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">' 
 

In similarly rejecting the application of Brownsville Nominees in the manner sought by the Secretary, Beaumont J concluded at 80 of his reasons for judgment that:
 
 'I have difficulty accepting the submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">In the first place, as has been noted, the definition of "decision" in s 3(1) of the ADJR Act is not confined to those cases where a duty to make a decision is imposed, although such decisions are also picked up...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">
 

Moreover at 88 of his reasons for judgment, Gummow J expressed his agreement with:
 
 '...what [was] said in the reasons for judgment of the other members of the Court as to the inadequacy of [ Brownsville Nominees ] as authority for the proposition that in the present case there could be no decision attracting the ADJR Act unless the Secretary was under a duty to act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">' 
 

I need add nothing further as to the absence of any assistance of Brownsville to the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">46 A further authority referred to by counsel for the Authority in the course of argument was Carter v Minister for Aboriginal Affairs [2005] FCA 667.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In that case, Ryan J held, inter alia , that the Minister's refusal to exercise his power under s 21D(2) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) to make a temporary declaration of preservation was not a decision for the purposes of s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">47 Subsections 21D(1) and (2) of that particular legislation were in the following terms: 
 
 
 '(1) If a local Aboriginal community decides, whether after an application is made to it or on its own motion, that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a place or object in the community area is an Aboriginal place or Aboriginal object; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) that place or object is under threat of injury or desecration; 
 
 
 
 
 
 the community may advise the Minister that it considers a temporary declaration of preservation should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) On receiving advice under subsection (1) or determining on his or her own motion that a temporary declaration of preservation should be made, the Minister: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) shall, within 14 days, cause notice of the advice or determination to be given to any person who is likely to be affected by the making of a declaration; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) shall give any such person an opportunity to be heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">' 
 
 
 

48 Ryan J found that the Minister there had not received advice from a local Aboriginal community in accordance with s 21D(1), and thus the issue of relevance was whether or not the Minister's decision not to determine[e] on his...own motion that a temporary declaration of preservation should be made was a reviewable decision for the purposes of s 5(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The Minister had informed the applicants in writing that he would 'consider' their request for a determination on his own motion, but later told the applicants that he would not do so pending the resolution of another proceeding before this Court involving the same artefacts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">His Honour found that the Minister's decision was a decision to decline to determine[e]...on his own motion and was thus made 'preparatory' to the making of a decision to determine to make a temporary declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Alternatively, his Honour characterised the decision declining to so determine[e] as 'a conclusion reached as a step on the way to an ultimate decision', which is not reviewable, for that reason also, thereby referring to dicta to like effect at 337 of Mason CJ's reasons for judgment in Bond .</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">49 The applicants submitted, in my opinion correctly, that the particular statutory framework addressed in Carter featured a 'staged process of decision-making' whereby before making the ultimate decision of imposing a temporary declaration of preservation , the Minister may make a decision to proceed with such a determination on his or her own motion, such a decision being clearly 'a step along the way'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">By contrast the present legislation (ie the Radiocommunications Act ) features no such stepped or staged decision-making, the power to make the ultimate or operative decision being conferred in its terms by s 111 and relevantly, s 111(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">On that basis at least, Carter is distinguishable from the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">50 The Authority submitted next that a similar conclusion to that which it advocated here was reached by an application of the principles stated by the High Court in Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 213 ALR 724.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The issue there arising was whether the decision of a university to exclude a candidate for a doctorate of philosophy on account of academic misconduct was made under an enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">In a majority finding to the contrary of that candidate's complaint, the following appears at [89] in the joint reasons for judgment of Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ to the negative of that proposition (their Honours' emphasis appears in non-italics):
 
 'The determination of whether a decision is "made... under an enactment" involves two criteria: first, the decision must be expressly or impliedly required or authorised by the enactment; and, secondly, the decision must itself confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, and in that sense the decision must derive from the enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">A decision will only be "made... under an enactment" if both these criteria are met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">It should be emphasised that this construction of the statutory definition does not require the relevant decision to affect or alter existing rights or obligations, and it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Similarly, it is not necessary that the relevantly affected legal rights owe their existence to the enactment in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Affection of rights or obligations derived from the general law or statute will suffice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">' 
 

Purportedly in the light of that dicta , the Authority contended that its '... decision not to entertain [WAL's] request, however it be characterised, did not confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights', but '... left them precisely as they were before the applicants requested the [Authority] to exercise its non-compellable discretionary power'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Even if that analysis of the Authority be correct in terms of the present circumstances of either one or both of the applicants, notwithstanding implications flowing historically from their enjoyment of transmission from the Tingalpa site, it is an analysis which in any event appears to fall short of the foregoing dicta in Griffith University that '... it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">I would add that counsel for the Authority conceded during the hearing that Griffith University would be of no assistance to him if I were to find that the Authority had in fact exercised its power under s 111 , as opposed to merely declining to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">At least the Authority's communications with the applicants in 2004 point to the former of those propositions as being the case, as do the Authority's file notes of the same year, as is I think sufficiently apparent from what I have earlier extracted therefrom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">
 

51 The submissions of the respondent Authority sought to conclude that '[f]or all of these reasons, the decision of the [Authority's] officers was not a decision under an enactment', and was '... not, therefore, a decision to which the [ADJR Act] applies ... [and] [s]imilarly, the lawfulness of the decision is not a matter arising under a law of the Parliament if it were made under a non-legislative policy'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The Authority did not elaborate on that latter submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">However it is clear that it was predicated on the Authority's construction of its decision that was contended by the applicants to be 'highly technical' and 'prefer[ring] form over substance, contrary to the remedial character of the ADJR Act'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">In essence, as I have foreshadowed already, the respondent Authority contended that the 'decision' was nothing more than the refusal of its own officers to consider whether to exercise the Authority's power under s 111 of the Act, that determination having been made by the relevant officers by reference to the policies of the Authority encapsulated in NAS PIP and NAS BOP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">52 The Authority accepted that '... this Court has jurisdiction under s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act to determine whether the [Authority] was under a duty to consider the applicants' request to vary [AusCoast's] licence condition', but asserted that '[n]onetheless, if this Court accepts that the [Authority] was not under such a duty (and remains free from such a duty), the Court would be unable to make an order in the nature of mandamus'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Absent such an order, so the Authority further submitted, there was no proper basis for any of the relief sought by the applicants', thereby citing Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Applicants S134/2002 (2003) 211 CLR 411 at [44]-[48] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) and at [98]-[100] (Gaudron and Kirby JJ), in each such instance containing observations relating to the operation of s 417(1) of the Migration Act , whereby the Minister is empowered to substitute for the RRT's decision a decision more favourable to an applicant for relief, if ' ... the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Once again I have difficulty in identifying any sufficiency of assistance of authority from a context involving quite different legislation; indeed s 417(7) of the Migration Act at least then explicitly stipulated that ' [t]he Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (1) in respect of any decision, whether he or she is requested to do so by the applicant or by any other person, or in any other circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">' In any event, as the applicants rightly pointed out, whether or not mandamus might be available against the Authority in relation to the operation of s 111 of the Act, relief pursuant to s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act for declaratory relief was sought by the applicants' amended application which Jacobson J accepted for filing in Court on 25 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">I have of course earlier referred to the applicants' case for relief being framed on that basis by way of additional or alternative relief to that afforded by the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">53 As to what the Authority referred to as its 'related alternative motion', the Authority contended that since AusCoast is currently broadcasting from premises which are not the premises specified on the conditions of its licence, such conduct was unlawful and improper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Accordingly, in case the Court was otherwise minded to entertain a grant of relief following a substantive hearing, it was submitted that relief should be refused as a matter of discretion; since the applicants here seek to protect and validate unlawful and improper conduct, and thereby attract the operation of the maxim of equity 'he who comes into equity must come with clean hands', discussed in R Meagher, D Heydon and M Leeming, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines &amp; Remedies , (4 th ed) at [3-110].</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The relief presently sought by the applicants is however in the nature of administrative and not equitable relief, the applicants having not purportedly founded any case on equitable estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">In any event I am of course presently concerned with the Authority's notice of objection to competency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The relevance of any such matters so raised by the Authority is limited to the Court's determination of final relief, should the Authority's objection to competency fail wholly or in part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">54 I should add for completeness that in a short supplementary submission, the Authority repeated the essence of its earlier submissions, and submitted further in the alternative as follows ( inter alia ):
 
 'If the court accepts that there is no duty [for the Authority to consider a request made for a variation of an apparatus licence under s 111] but considers that, nonetheless, the Authority made a decision under s 111, the matter would need to go to a substantive hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">There would then be an argument about whether a reviewable error was made in that legislative context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">There would also be a discretionary issue too.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">' 
 

It is sufficient for me to respond to that supplementary submission at the present stage of the proceedings by referring to the interlocutory decision upon which I have arrived below in the light of the respective submissions of the parties, which have been addressed on the basis of the Authority's objection to competency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Conclusions 
 
55 I am of the opinion that the Authority's objection to competency in its presently amended form must be dismissed, for reasons which I have largely foreshadowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">56 The applicants have rightly contended that the following decisions of the respondent Authority are reviewable by the Court under and pursuant to the provisions of the ADJR Act:
 
 
 (i) the decision of the Authority made on 30 June 2005 under s 111 of the Act not to exercise its power to change the condition on its radiocommunications apparatus licence number 1130030 (called the 1620 licence) granted to AusCoast, such that the site for the operation of that licence be altered from 170 Kingsley Terrace Manly, Brisbane in the State of Queensland to 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa, Brisbane in that State ('the first decision'); 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) the further decision by the Authority made on 18 August 2005 not to reconsider the first decision under s 285(g) of the Act; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the further decision by the Authority also made on 18 August 2005 to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons for the first decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">
 
 
 

57 I am further of the opinion, to the extent that it may therefore matter, that in so far as the Authority has contended that the subject decisions of the Authority did not arise under any laws made by the Parliament pursuant to s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , that further contention must also fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">58 It will have been appreciated from observations that I have made in the course of my outline of these reasons for judgment that I would reject the contention of the Authority that its decision-making of 30 June 2005 merely constituted a withholding from consideration of a request of either or both of the applicants to change the site condition of the 1620 licence, whether pursuant to an exercise of a discretionary function or power generally or at large on the Authority's part, or otherwise, and in particular whether by way of exercise of a discretionary power conferred under s 111 of the Act, or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The applicants, or at least WAL on behalf of both of them, in substance and in reality, applied unambiguously to the Authority on 6 August 2004 to change the site condition for the subject apparatus licence being a change which the Authority was empowered to implement pursuant to s 111 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">A statutory decision-maker does not avoid the operation of the review provisions of the ADJR Act by purporting to create, whether explicitly or implicitly, a standpoint or position involving a decliner of entry upon statutory decision-making, or for that matter of consideration of decision-making unless the statutory scheme for decision-making so provides (cf Carter ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">So much however is in reality the position or standpoint which the Authority has seemingly endeavoured to adopt and maintain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">59 Thus by way of reflection of the dictum I have cited from Bond , the communications of the Authority as evidenced from the outset by its faxed response of 16 August 2004 to the applicants' application of 6 August 2004 and thereafter, inclusive of its critical communication to WAL of 30 June 1995, the Authority indicated to the applicants the position which it had adopted or taken as inherently and essentially indicative of decision-making on its part, the same having for instance the 'character or quality of finality', and constituting and involving 'an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application' within the scope of that dictum of Mason CJ in Bond I have earlier cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">That communication of the Authority constituted or involved a decision 'at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">It was 'a substantive determination' as opposed to a 'procedural determination', to adopt the Chief Justice's further dictum in Bond .</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">60 Moreover by way of reflection of dicta I have cited from Right to Life , and in particular from that of Lockhart J at 62, I would characterise the Authority's conduct culminating in its faxed response of 30 June 2005 as similarly indicative of a conclusion having been reached by the Authority in or to the effect of the first decision postulated in the applicants' amended application filed in Court on 25 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The Authority made thereby a decision under s 111 not to effect a variation to one of the conditions it had imposed on the 1620 licence pursuant to s 107(1)(g) of the Act, namely the condition stipulating the transmission site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The Authority's communication of 30 June 2005 constituted or involved moreover the very opposite or antithesis of the decision which the applicants had been seeking from the Authority, commencing from WAL's application of 6 August 2004 made to the Authority, being a decision the implications and consequences whereof clearly and in substance affected rights and obligations of the applicants concerning the 1620 licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">61 It follows in my opinion that the Authority's objection to competency must fail, at least for the reason that such objection is founded on the erroneous proposition that no decision has been relevantly made under an enactment, pursuant to s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Whilst that conclusion renders unnecessary any conclusion to be reached as to whether a matter relevantly arose under any law made by the Parliament for the purpose of the operation of s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , I am unable to identify any viable basis in favour of a negative response to that latter proposition of the applicants as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">It is moreover not accurate for the Authority to contend that its refusal was a decision made pursuant to a policy as opposed to an enactment, any resemblance here to the factual situation prevailing in Bedlington being merely chimerical, for the reasons that I have indicated above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">62 It follows from my foregoing conclusions that the Authority's refusal to vary the 1620 licence site condition involves a matter arising under a law made by Parliament of the Commonwealth, the legislative authority to make that decision being conferred by s 111 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Accordingly I would further find that the purported ground of objection pleaded by the Authority in the alternative, namely that '... there is no proper basis upon which to grant relief to the applicant', must also fail, owing to the availability at least of declaratory relief to the applicants for the reasons I have earlier explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">63 Accordingly the application for review of the first decision sought by the applicants' amended application filed in Court on 25 August 2005 must proceed to a final hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">64 It follows moreover, in the light of all of my foregoing findings, that the further applications to review the Authority's decision of 18 August 2005 not to reconsider its prior principal decision of 30 June 2005, and also the Authority's yet further decision made at the same time to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons in respect of the first decision, must also proceed to a final hearing, the first decision not being one excluded from the operation of s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">65 I should add for completeness that the further concluding contention raised by the Authority in any event to the effect that since AusCoast presently broadcasts from premises at Tingalpa which are not the premises specified in the conditions of the 1620 licence, being conduct asserted by the Authority to be 'unlawful and improper', the Court should as a matter of discretion refuse that relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">That subject must be a question for another day, and is irrelevant to the issue of competency per se for the reasons I have already indicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Doubtless on that further occasion, the applicants would seek to pursue in more detail the circumstances and implications of the conduct of the Authority relating to the variation of the site condition on the 1611 licence to the Bracken Ridge Reservoir transmission site, being a conceivable issue apparently to be raised by the applicants from which I would necessarily withhold from further comment at this interlocutory stage of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Whether that subject is in any event a matter for legitimate consideration in the context of the administrative relief sought by the applicants would be a matter for submission at that further hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">66 The Authority having failed on what has been analogous to a demurrer to the applicants' cause of action, I see no good reason in principle why the applicants should not have the benefit of an award of costs in their favour of and incidental to the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">67 The proceedings will be stood over to a date to be fixed by agreement by the parties, or by the Court in the event that no agreement is reached, for the purpose or making such declarations and orders as may be appropriate to give effect to these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">

 EDMONDS J: 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This is an appeal, pursuant to s 44 of the Administration Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act'), from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by Mr P J Lindsay, Senior Member ('the Tribunal'), given on 18 January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The Tribunal's decision was recorded in the following terms:
 
 'The tribunal affirms the decision under review in relation to the inclusion of the sum of $1,228,500 in the applicant's assessable income for the year ended 30 June 1988, but in relation to penalty remits the matter to the respondent with the direction that the assessment for that income year be amended by remitting additional tax in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">' 
 

3 The Commissioner of Taxation ('the Commissioner') appeals from so much of the Tribunal's decision as remits the matter of additional tax to the Commissioner with the direction that such additional tax be remitted in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">4 The Commissioner, in his Amended Notice of Appeal, states that the following questions of law are raised on the appeal ---
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Whether the Tribunal exceeded the jurisdiction conferred on it by section 14ZZ of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 [(Cth) ('the Administration Act')] in purporting to direct the Applicant to remit in full additional tax imposed on the Respondent for the year ended 30 June 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The proper interpretation of sections 14ZQ and 14ZS of the [Administration Act] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Whether the Tribunal erred in law in purporting to direct the Applicant to remit additional tax in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">' 
 
 
 

5 The grounds of appeal are stated in the same document (at par 4) in the following terms:
 
 
 '4.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Tribunal erred in law in failing to hold that the Applicant's decision on objection refusing to remit additional tax imposed pursuant to sec 223 was an "ineligible income tax remission decision" under section 14ZS of the [Administration Act] and therefore not a "reviewable objection decision" for the purposes of section 14ZQ of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
 4.2 The Tribunal erred in law in purporting to direct the Applicant to remit the additional tax in full, in circumstances where there was no jurisdiction to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.3 The Tribunal should have held that the Applicant's decision refusing to remit the additional tax was not a "reviewable objection decision" within the meaning of section 14ZQ of the [Administration Act] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.4 In so far as the Tribunal purported to direct the Applicant to remit additional tax payable under either section 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 or Division 1 of Part IIA of the [Administration Act] , the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make such a direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.5 If, contrary to the grounds set out in paragraphs 4.1 to 4.4 above, the Tribunal did have jurisdiction to direct that additional tax be remitted in full, the Tribunal, in purporting to make such a direction, erred in law in taking into account an irrelevant consideration namely the Applicant's consent to the matter remaining in abeyance before the Tribunal pending finalisation of other proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">' 
 
 
 
 BACKGROUND 
 
6 On 24 June 1994, following an audit, the Commissioner issued the respondent taxpayer with an amended assessment of income tax for the year ended 30 June 1988 including in his assessable income for that year an amount of $1,228,500 received by him in respect of a certain large infrastructure project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Additional Tax for incorrect return, shown at label D of the notice of amended assessment, in the sum of $586,858.75, was also imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 The taxpayer, by his taxation agent, lodged an objection to the amended assessment by letter dated 5 July 1994, but the grounds were confined to the inclusion of the sum of $1,228,500 in his assessable income and did not put in issue the imposition of the additional tax of $586,858.75.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 By letter dated 16 February 1996 the Commissioner disallowed the taxpayer's objection for the reason:
 
 'It is considered that the income received from Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd and Transfield Pty Ltd forms part of your assessable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">' 
 
 

Not surprisingly, the objection decision made no reference to the imposition of additional tax because it was not raised as a ground of objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Indeed, it was not mentioned in the objection at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">9 By letter dated 31 October 2003 solicitors acting for the taxpayer filed a statement of facts, issues and contentions on behalf of the taxpayer, however, the matter of additional tax was not raised as an issue and it certainly formed no part of the taxpayer's contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Not surprisingly, the Commissioner's amended statement of facts, issues and contentions dated 26 October 2004, likewise made no reference to the matter of additional tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">10 The first time the matter of additional tax or 'penalty', as it is sometimes referred to, was raised was before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">How it was raised and why the Tribunal allowed it to be raised is not disclosed in the transcript of proceedings before the Tribunal, nor in the Tribunal's reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">However, these documents suggest, with respect, that:
 
 (i) Neither counsel for the taxpayer, nor counsel for the Commissioner, nor the Tribunal was aware that the taxpayer had not included any ground in his notice of objection going to the additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">So much is exemplified in the following extract from p-95 of the transcript of the hearing on the second day (19 November 2004):
 'MR QUINN [Counsel for the Commissioner] : Just briefly on penalty, we say it is a matter --- the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">We say there wasn't full and true disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I mean, it couldn't be the case that having regard to the number of taxpayers and the way the Commissioner must administer the Act that not to put at least copies of the agreements, that that was full disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">To that extent we say that the amount of penalty is appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Unless there's anything else ---' 
 
 
 (ii) If counsel for the taxpayer was aware that the taxpayer had not included any ground in his notice of objection going to the additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, no attempt was made, by way of application to the Tribunal, to include the additional tax issue as an additional ground of objection and, even if an application was made, no such order was made by the Tribunal pursuant to s 14ZZK of the Administration Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">On the hearing of the appeal there was an interruptive protestation on the part of counsel for the taxpayer that any such conclusion would be misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However, it was not taken further (apart from what was said to be anecdotal evidence from the bar table) in the written submissions I afforded counsel for the taxpayer, at his request, further time to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">


 
 (iii) The Tribunal seems to have regarded itself as having jurisdiction with respect to not only additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, but also additional tax by way of interest for late payment of tax assessed pursuant to s 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the ITAA 36').</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">So much is exemplified in the following extract from p-77 of the transcript of the hearing on the second day:
 
 'MR RAPHAEL: Now, if we might go to the question of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 MR LINDSAY: And on that the witness gave evidence, did he --- the applicant gave evidence that the sum assessed has not yet been paid?</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 
 MR RAPHAEL: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 
 MR LINDSAY: So there must be quite a large amount of interest that has accrued on this sum, is that --- 
 
 MR RAPHAEL: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 
 MR LINDSAY: I'm not privy to all of the --- I haven't read all of the detail, Mr Raphael --- 
 
 MR RAPHAEL: One should not give evidence from the bar table but --- 
 
 MR LINDSAY: No, I know, but you are trying to --- I'm getting some assistance from you, but is interest running from 1987 on this amount?</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 
 MR RAPHAEL: So I would tender the report of the Australian Tax Office ...' 
 
 It is also exemplified in the Tribunal's reasons for decision:
 
 
 
 '57.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Where a taxpayer omits an item of assessable income from their return, s.223(7) deems the taxpayer to have made a statement in their return to the effect that they did not derive that item of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The provision applies in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 
 
 
 
 
 58.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">... 
 
 
 
 
 
 59.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I find that there are mitigating circumstances present in this matter that should be taken into account on review in the exercise of the discretion in s.227(3) to remit additional tax: 
 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">... 
 
 
 
 
 
 61.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">I accept the applicant's submission that this transaction or dealing is one that falls into the clearly arguable category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I also accept that his income tax return gave the respondent some information about the transaction and this should be contrasted with the situation where there is a total omission of any reference to the particular transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Having regard to the policy of encouraging accuracy and completeness of returns that is embodied in s.223, but being cognisant also that the discretion has been introduced to mitigate potential harshness resulting from the imposition of penalty under s.223(1) being double the amount of tax avoided, I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case in which to remit the culpability component of the penalty in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In relation to the per annum component, it is relevant to note that the respondent consented to the matter being held in abeyance for a number of years pending the finalisation of proceedings brought by Jones, extending to his appeals to the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I consider it appropriate that any per annum component be remitted for the entire period from the date of issue of the amended assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">' 
 
 
 

11 While the Tribunal's ultimate decision ([2], supra) in relation to 'penalty' is clearly a reference to additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, it is equally clear, in my view, that what the Tribunal is referring to in the last two sentences of par 61 of its reasons for decision and in the extract from the transcript cited above is the additional tax by way of interest pursuant to s 207 of the ITAA 36 and, if it is, it is clearly beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This latter matter was not, however, the subject of the Tribunal's ultimate decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It follows that ground 4.5 of the Amended Notice of Appeal is misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">12 I hesitate to suggest this, but it seems to me that the Tribunal's analysis of the 'penalty' issue was a function of the confused thinking inherent in the submissions put to the Tribunal by both counsel below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">This is further exemplified in the Commissioner's grounds of appeal and in his original written submissions, both having as their focus the construction and application of s 14ZS and, by force of the definitions therein, s 14ZQ of the Administration Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">13 It is s 14ZS, as originally enacted (see Taxation Laws Amendment (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">3) Act 1991 (Cth)), that applies to objection decisions that relate to the remission of additional tax under s 223 of the ITAA 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">As originally enacted, s 14ZS relevantly provided:
 
 
 '(1) For the purposes of this Part, an objection decision is an ineligible income tax remission decision if subsection (2) ... applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) An objection decision is an ineligible income tax remission decision if it relates to the remission of additional tax payable by a taxpayer under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 other than Division 11 of Part IIIAA , except where the additional tax is payable under Part VII of that Act and its amount, after the decision is made, exceeds: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) in the case of additional tax payable under section 223 of that Act because of the making of a statement: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) if the statement relates to only one year of income --- the amount calculated, in respect of the period commencing on the day that is the prescribed day in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income and ending on the day on which the assessment of the additional tax is made, at the rate of 20% per year of the amount of the relevant affected tax in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) ...' (Emphasis added) 
 
 
 
 

14 Relevantly, s 14ZQ defined 'objection decision' as having the meaning given by subs 14ZY(2), namely, by reference to subs 14ZY(1), a decision of the Commissioner to allow an objection, wholly or in part, or to disallow it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">15 It is difficult to understand the focus of the Commissioner on s 14ZS of the Administration Act in the present case when neither the taxpayer's objection nor, in consequence, the Commissioner's objection decision, referred in any way to the remission of additional tax imposed by the amended notice of assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In support of that focus I was referred to cases which, correctly in my view, hold that the words 'relates to' are wide words signifying some connection between two subject matters --- with the connection or association signified by the words being either direct or indirect, substantial or real.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">However, in the present case, there is absolutely no connection or association between the objection decision and the remission of additional tax payable under s 223 of the ITAA 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It may be, as the Full court of this Court observed in Grollo Nominees Pty Ltd v FC of T (1997) 73 FCR 452 at 523, 
 
 'that it would seem an odd thing if there were ... an appeal to the Tribunal on the question of the amount of income tax payable which did not carry with it the right to question any consequential imposition of additional tax', 
 
 

but this is such a case, in the absence of the Tribunal making an order pursuant to s 14ZZK of the Administration Act allowing the taxpayer to include the additional tax issue as an additional ground of objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In short, the objection decision in the present case is not an ineligible income tax remission decision under s 14ZS of the Administration Act and, insofar as the Commissioner's appeal is grounded on this issue, it must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">16 In his written submissions in reply, the Commissioner refocussed his argument, to where it always should have been focussed, on subs 43(1) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">17 Subsection 43(1) of the AAT Act is in the following terms:
 
 'For the purpose of reviewing a decision, the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred by any relevant enactment on the person who made the decision and shall make a decision in writing: 
 
 
 
 (a) affirming the decision under review; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) varying the decision under review; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) setting aside the decision under review and: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) making a decision in substitution for the decision so set aside; or 
 
 (ii) remitting the matter for reconsideration in accordance with any directions or recommendations of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">' 
 
 
 
 

18 The Commissioner submitted that the present appeal was one where the remission of penalty by the Tribunal could not have been for the purpose of reviewing the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It was not relevant to the making of the decision because the parameters of that decision had already been set by the taxpayer's objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It could not have been properly raised by the taxpayer before the Tribunal unless and until an order was obtained by the taxpayer under s 14ZZK(a) of the Administration Act which did not occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">As such, there could not be 'an association' between the power exercised by the Tribunal and the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">If an objection had been made to the assessment of penalty and an objection decision had been made in relation to that matter, there may have been (subject to the operation of s 14ZS of the Administration Act) some basis for saying that the exercise of a power to remit by the Tribunal was in the words of Hill J in Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson (1992) 37 FCR 32 'relevant to the making of the decision under review'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">There would be present 'an association' between any exercise of discretion by the Tribunal to remit penalty and the objection decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">19 In my view, this misconceives the matter and puts an impermissible gloss upon s 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">20 While the taxpayer did not include in his objection a ground putting in issue the imposition of additional tax; and while the Commissioner's objection decision disallowing the taxpayer's objection did not, in consequence, deal with that issue; and while the taxpayer had no right to agitate the issue before the Tribunal unless the Tribunal otherwise ordered (s 14ZZK(a) of the Administration Act), which the Tribunal did not, nevertheless, in deciding the taxpayer's objection, the Commissioner could have further remitted the additional tax imposed at label D of the notice of amended assessment, pursuant to the discretion vested in him by subs 227(3) of the ITAA 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The fact that he had already exercised this discretion, at the time of assessment to remit the additional tax to $586,858.75 was no bar or impediment to his further remission of the additional tax at the time of making his objection decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">21 If this be right, then it is difficult to see why subs 43(1) of the AAT Act did not give the Tribunal jurisdiction to make that part of the decision against which this appeal is brought, namely, remission of the penalty matter to the Commissioner with the direction that the assessment for the year ended 30 June 1988 be amended by remitting additional tax in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Subsection 43(1) of the AAT Act has been construed as not requiring the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal as being necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review: Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson supra at 39 --- 40.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 244 (30 November 2005, unreported) the Full Court of this Court observed at [29] --- [30]:
 
 '...Section 43 empowers the Tribunal to exercise all the powers and discretions conferred upon the original decision-maker, provided it does so for the purpose of reviewing a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Provided the necessary purpose is present, the power conferred upon the Tribunal is not otherwise limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">It is neither necessary nor permissible to put a gloss upon s 43 that would permit the Tribunal to exercise the discretion maker's powers and discretions only when those powers or discretions are necessarily interdependent with the decision under review, or where the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal is necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review --- see Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson [supra].</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 Thus, so long as the exercise of powers and discretions by the Tribunal is for the purpose of reviewing a decision, all of the powers and discretions conferred by any relevant enactment on the decision-maker who made the decision, can be exercised by the Tribunal' (Emphasis)
 

22 In making this observation, the Full Court was adopting the views expressed by Hill J in Hodgson .</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In particular, what his Honour went on to say in that case at 40:
 
 'Of course there must be an association between the power to be exercised by the Tribunal and the decision under review, but that association is to be found in the restriction of the grant of power in s 43(1) to the purpose of the Tribunal's review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The test is one of relevance rather than dependence .</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Where the exercise of a power or discretion is relevant to the making of the decision under review then, if requested, the Tribunal may exercise the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">' (Emphasis)
 

23 There can be no doubt, in the present case, that the exercise by the Tribunal of the discretion to remit the matter of the additional tax to the Commissioner with a direction that the additional tax be remitted in full is relevant to the making of the objection decision, if not dependent upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In that sense, the Tribunal exercised the discretion for the purpose of reviewing the objection decision and any argument that it did not must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">24 For the foregoing reasons, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">

 Background to the current application 
 
1 The applicants Sharman Networks Ltd ('Sharman Networks'), Sharman License Holdings Ltd ('Sharman License') and Ms Nicola Anne Hemming ('Ms Hemming') are each the subject of asset preservation orders made by Wilcox J on 22 March 2005 ('the Mareva orders').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">When referring to the applicants generally, I will do so as 'the Sharman applicants'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Each of the Sharman applicants was one of ten respondents to infringement of copyright proceedings brought by the present respondents ('the Music companies') in respect of the operation of what was described by the parties as the 'Kazaa system' ('the primary proceedings').</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Wilcox J made orders ancillary to the Mareva orders on 22 March 2005 requiring each of the Sharman applicants to disclose on affidavit the description and value of all of their assets, wherever situated, and to specify whether those assets were held by each applicant either beneficially or in trust for any other person or entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 Wilcox J delivered judgment on the complex issues of liability arising in the primary proceedings on 5 September 2005 ( Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In the meantime, Ms Hemming had filed two disclosure affidavits pursuant to Wilcox J's orders of 22 March 2005 whilst Sharman License and Sharman Networks had unsuccessfully sought several stays on various grounds of that same order insofar as it applied to them (see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 406 per Hely J, delivered 8 April 2005; Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 441 per Wilcox J, delivered 15 April 2005 and Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 505 per Moore J, delivered 28 April 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Disclosure affidavits were eventually sworn on behalf of Sharman License and Sharman Networks by Mr Gee on 19 April 2005, which were later superseded by further affidavits sworn also by Mr Gee on 16 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Sharman License and Sharman Networks had also unsuccessfully sought an enlargement of time in which to file an application for leave to appeal from Wilcox J's orders of 22 March 2005 (see Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 per Lindgren J, delivered on 17 June 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 On 24 May 2005, the Music companies filed a further amended notice of motion seeking further orders ancillary to the Mareva orders, which application was heard over several days by Moore J and determined by his Honour on 17 November 2005 substantially in favour of the Music companies ( Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1587).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The Sharman applicants acknowledge that the orders made by Moore J pursuant to that determination were interlocutory in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">What had led to the Music companies' application for those ancillary orders were deficiencies in the asset disclosure affidavits provided by the Sharman applicants pursuant to the ancillary orders of Wilcox J made on 22 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It is from Moore J's interlocutory judgment of 17 November 2005 that the Sharman applicants presently seek leave to appeal, pursuant to O 52 r 10(2) of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 The principal orders made by Moore J on 17 November 2005 were as follows:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The applicants have leave to cross examine [Ms Hemming] on the affidavits filed and served by her in response to Order 5 of the orders of Wilcox J made on 22 March 2005, on such matters as the Court may later direct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">[Ms Hemming] file and serve, within such time and [sic] the Court may specify, an affidavit that discloses with particularity the description and value of all the assets of [Sharman Networks] (and its subsidiaries within the meaning of section 9 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that are wholly owned) wherever situated and specifying whether those assets are held by [Sharman Networks] (or such wholly owned subsidiaries) beneficially or in trust for any other person or entity and further specifying: 
 
 
 
 a. in the case of any bank accounts which [Sharman Networks] (or such wholly owned subsidiaries) controls, the name of the bank in which the account is held, the name of the branch, the name of the account, the name of a person in whose name the account is held, the account number, and the balance of the account as at the date of service of the orders; 
 
 b. the name and address of any person or entity who holds any assets on trust or as nominee for [Sharman Networks] (or such wholly owned subsidiary); 
 
 c. details of any trust or arrangement pursuant to which such assets are held; 
 
 d. details of any charge, mortgage or other security grouped in relation to any asset; and 
 
 e. details of any contracts entered into for the sale, mortgage, charge or other disposition of the assets or any part thereof or interest therein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Order 1 made by Wilcox J on 22 March 2005 is varied by inserting before the words "other than" the following words: 
 
 (and, as to [Sharman Networks], be restrained from causing or permitting any wholly owned subsidiary to dispose of, to remove from Australia or to deal with in any way any of that subsidiary's money, property or other assets in or outside Australia)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">' 
 
 

5 The immediate background to much of the debate presently raised by the Sharman applicants, and as a consequence the principal focus of their attack upon the orders of Moore J below, concerned the existence of alleged shortcomings in the asset disclosures, and in particular the implications of a payment of $1,116,405.63 made by Ms Hemming to a Vanuatu company, Trustees International Limited ('TIL'), following upon the sale of the Sydney residence of Ms Hemming and Dr Kilmer-Barber for $2,100,000 on 4 February 2005, being a payment made purportedly by way of repayment of a loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Music companies' case presented to Moore J below was that there was in fact no such antecedent loan, that the transfer of such funds by Ms Henning to TIL in Vanuatu constituted a sham loan repayment, and that such funds have therefore continued to be her own moneys on the footing presumably of a constructive trust, and should have been identified as such in her affidavit of disclosure of her assets made pursuant to the Mareva orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Although Moore J declined to make a finding in relation to the issue as to ownership of that fund, his Honour formed the view that he would permit cross-examination of Ms Hemming on matters concerning the fund, by reason of doubts attending the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">His Honour reasoned in that regard at [37] of his reasons for judgment as follows:
 
 'In all, real doubts arise about, and uncertainty surrounds, the reason why this transaction took place when it did and whether the monies transferred to TIL were, in truth, in satisfaction of a loan or continues to constitute an asset of, and requires disclosure by [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Greater clarity about this matter may arise from the cross-examination of [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">' 
 
 Legal principles informing the grant of leave to appeal 
 
6 Section 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) stipulates that an appeal shall not be brought from a judgment of the Court constituted by a single judge, being a judgment that is interlocutory in nature, unless the Court or a Judge gives leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Although s 24(1A) does not purport to qualify or limit the Court's discretion (see D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 399 in the joint reasons for judgment of Sheppard, Burchett and Heerey JJ), the Courts have developed general principles which inform the exercise of the discretion to refuse or grant leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The rationale for those principles is the public interest in the efficient administration of justice, and the maintenance of 'the integrity and vigour of the procedures of the court, including as they do, the immediate involvement of the judge at all stages in the progress of cases to trial' ( Bomanite Pty Ltd v Slatex Corp Australia Pty Ltd (1991) 104 ALR 165 at 173, per Gummow J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">One consequence sought to be avoided is the expansion of expensive and delaying pre-trial litigation involved in appeals on issues of practice and procedure, and the concomitant reduction in the authority of the trial judge, should such appeals be frequently entertained ( Bomanite at 176, per French J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">7 At least for those reasons, this Court has held on a number of occasions that typically a party seeking leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment ought to establish, first, that in all the circumstances, the decision from which leave is sought to appeal is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant the same being reconsidered by the Full Court, and secondly, that substantial injustice would result if such leave was to be refused, supposing the decision to have been wrong: see D&eacute;cor at 398.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">That those two questions were the touchstone of exercise of discretion in matters of this kind was common ground between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I observe that it is well accepted that those criteria are not to be applied rigidly or fixedly, and the Court must bear in mind all of the circumstances of the particular case: see in that regard Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Phillip Morris Incorporated [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 177, where Gibbs CJ, Aickin, Wilson and Brennan JJ said:
 
 'For ourselves, we believe it to be unnecessary and indeed unwise to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The circumstances of different cases are infinitely various.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">We would merely repeat, with approval, the oft-cited statement of Sir Frederick Jordan in re the Will of F B Gilbert (dec) (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 318 at 323: 
 
 
 
 "...I am of the opinion that...there is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a point of practice or procedure and an exercise of discretion which determines substantive rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">In the former class of case, if a tight rein were not kept upon interference with the orders of Judges of first instance, the result would be disastrous to the proper administration of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The disposal of cases could be delayed interminably, and costs heaped up indefinitely, if a litigant with a long purse or a litigious disposition could, at will, in effect transfer all exercises of discretion in interlocutory applications from a Judge in chambers to a Court of Appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">"
 
 
 
 ...It is safe to say that the question of injustice flowing from the order appealed from will generally be a relevant and necessary consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">' 
 

8 It was the Music companies' contention that the orders of Moore J, from which leave to appeal is now sought, determined matters of practice and procedure within the foregoing statements of principle, involving as they did the obligation of Ms Hemming to submit to cross-examination on affidavits made by her in early April of this year, and to file a separate affidavit disclosing the assets of Sharman Networks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Those obligations were said to be no different in principle to any other interlocutory procedural order of the court, whether made pre-trial or during a trial, requiring parties to swear affidavits, to answer questions in cross-examination and to provide documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">On the question of what constitutes 'substantial injustice' for the purposes of determining an application for leave to appeal, counsel for the Music companies placed particular reliance upon the decision of the Full Federal Court delivered earlier in the primary proceedings, which denied leave to appeal from a decision by Wilcox J refusing to set aside Anton Piller orders that his Honour had earlier made: Brilliant Digital Entertainment Pty Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (2004) 63 IPR 373.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">I will refer further to that authority shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">9 The Sharman applicants sought to emphasise the existence of practical burdens imposed by the orders made by Moore J on 17 November 2005, although in reality it was principally with respect to the order for cross-examination of Ms Hemming to which that assertion was directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">They maintained that the requirement to appear for cross-examination was not analogous to the 'routine steps' of swearing an affidavit during the normal course of a trial and entering the witness box to answer questions related to its contents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Rather, the requirement to be cross-examined on an asset disclosure affidavit was said to be 'at the extreme end of the Court's armoury', by virtue of the fact that the making of an order for cross-examination on an affidavit of this kind is predicated upon the Court having implicitly found the deponent of that affidavit to be in contempt of court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">I was referred by the Sharman applicants to an earlier Full Federal Court decision in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Wong [2002] FCAFC 327 in support of their submission that since the present circumstances give rise to an important question of principle, leave to appeal should be readily granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The parties' respective submissions concerning material matters bearing upon the justification or otherwise for the grant of orders ancillary to the Mareva relief and my incidental observations 
 
10 The affidavit filed in support of the application for leave to appeal by Mr Rohan Higgins, the solicitor for the Sharman applicants, contained the following broad submission under the heading '[i]njustice if leave is refused':
 
 'If leave to appeal is not granted then the orders of Moore J will operate and will have to be complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Any subsequent challenge to those orders would then be futile and academic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The orders are interlocutory in form but final in the result in relation to the issues raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">' 


So much is correct as a general statement as to the consequences of his Honour's orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">However, the nature and context of the application for leave here involved in practical terms an appeal, or virtually so, as will hereafter emerge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 

11 The Music companies contended that the Sharman applicants' submissions proceeded in reality 'on the erroneous basis that every interlocutory decision that requires a party to do an act will be automatically susceptible to leave to appeal and to being stayed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Music companies' position was that the orders requiring Ms Hemming to file an affidavit disclosing the assets of Sharman Networks, and to attend for cross-examination on the affidavit she had earlier sworn as to disclosure of her assets, were merely procedural in nature and therefore, incapable as such of determining any final rights of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">So much accorded with Moore J's understanding of the nature of those orders, as indicated in [30] of his Honour's reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">12 The primary submission made by the Music companies as to why leave to appeal ought not to be granted related to the failure of the Sharman applicants to adduce evidence demonstrative of the claim that they would suffer 'substantial injustice', should leave be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The Music companies rejected any notion to the effect that the mere fact of Ms Hemming being compelled to swear an affidavit as to disclosure of Sharman Networks' assets, and to attend for cross-examination upon her own disclosure affidavits, without more, amounted to 'substantial injustice', in the sense that such expression has been used in numerous authorities concerned with the grant of leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Reference was made to Gerlach v Clifton Bricks Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 22 ; (2002) 209 CLR 478, in which Gaudron, McHugh and Hayne JJ, in a different context, considered that the bare proposition that an order mandating 'trial by judge alone, as opposed to trial by judge and jury, can amount, without more, to a substantial wrong to a party or to a miscarriage of justice, [was] a startling proposition'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The reality of the dilemma in which the Court is placed by the present application is the need for consideration in some depth of the matters to which attention has been drawn by the Sharman applicants, before determining whether leave to appeal ought formally to be granted to appeal in the first place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Sharman applicants relied upon a further passage from the majority's reasons for judgment in Gerlach at [13], as follows:
 
 'The principles governing the grant of leave to appeal against interlocutory orders are well established...If it is plain that wrong principle was applied by the judge considering the application, it may well be that leave should be granted...' 
 

13 The Music companies, for their part, placed particular reliance upon the joint reasons for judgment of Black CJ and Stone J in Brilliant Digital for the approach that they contended ought to be adopted in my consideration of the present application for leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In refusing leave to appeal from Wilcox J's decision to decline to set aside earlier Anton Piller orders that had been made in the course of the subject litigation, their Honours were said not to have considered at all the merits of the contemplated appeal there in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The following passages appearing at [7]-[8] and [13]-[14] of their Honour's reasons for judgment in Brilliant Digital were asserted by the Music companies to be apposite to the present application: 
 
 '[7] In our view these matters [the matters contended by the applicants to amount to substantial injustice] would not, either individually or cumulatively, occasion injustice to the applicants of such a character and to such a degree as to justify the grant of leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">While it is neither necessary nor appropriate to attempt to define the concept of substantial injustice some observations may be ventured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The flexibility of the principles governing the grant of leave to appeal indicates that the concept of substantial injustice must also be flexible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The requirement of leave to appeal indicates, however, that substantial injustice requires something more than that the subject decision is incorrect, otherwise the criterion would be superfluous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The qualification of "injustice" by "substantial" points to a detriment that, while not necessarily irreparable, is more than mere inconvenience or delay in the exercise of a right .</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 
 [8] The distinction between interlocutory decisions concerning matters of practice and procedure and those that concern the substantive interests of the parties recognises both the greater likelihood of an incorrect decision as to a substantive right causing substantial injustice and the importance of preserving a judge's power to supervise the orderly preparation of a matter for trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">In determining whether there has been substantial injustice it is appropriate for the court to take these factors into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The need to keep a tight rein upon interference with orders at first instance that do not determine substantive rights has even more force today in the context of procedural reforms and active case management undertaken with a view to the early identification of the real issues between the parties and the expeditious and efficient resolution of them... 
 
 [13] The challenged orders were plainly directed to matters of practice and procedure and did not determine any substantive rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">They were directed to the capture and preservation of certain data and information and this purpose has now been effected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Importantly, the applicants for leave do not seek to reverse this by destruction of the material seized pursuant to the challenged orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The primary judge has now made orders relating to the use of the material seized including its safekeeping by an independent party and, subject to appropriate confidentiality undertakings, the making of a safety or backup copy of the material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Orders have also been made granting preliminary access to the material for the purpose of any application that includes material not falling within the challenged orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The music companies are to have only such access to the seized material as would be normally available on discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">This shows that there is presently in train an orderly process for the management of the seized material in which the interests of both parties will receive due consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
 [14] In these circumstances we are far from satisfied that substantial injustice would follow from refusing the application for leave to appeal and, on that basis, we would refuse leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">That being so we do not propose to comment on the correctness or otherwise of the decision of the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Nothing we have said should be taken as suggesting that the making of the challenged orders was not a serious matter requiring very careful consideration by the primary judge; plainly, whether or not the applicants are correct in their contention that his decision was erroneous, the application for the challenged orders and the subsequent application to set them aside did receive consideration of that character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">' 
 

 (The emphasis appearing in [7] above in non-italics is mine).</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 

14 The Music companies contended that the orders made by Moore J were truly interlocutory in nature, rather than substantial in effect, being directed to 'the capture and preservation' of assets of the Sharman applicants pursuant to the Mareva relief granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">They pointed out that Moore J had reached his decision to impose those orders after careful application of the relevant legal principles, with due consideration of the lengthy evidence put before him by both parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Moreover, Moore J was said to have made it clear in [39] of his reasons for judgment that any cross-examination would be subject to the control of the Court, thereby limiting any prejudice that may be suffered by Ms Hemming or the other applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In those circumstances, counsel for the Music companies further contended that the applicants had failed to show that the obligations imposed upon them by Moore J amounted to anything greater than 'mere inconvenience'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">On that footing, the Music companies concluded that the Sharman applicants had failed to overcome the threshold requirement of establishing substantial injustice, and that leave to appeal should be refused on that basis alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Acceptance of that proposition was said to have the consequence realistically that consideration of the draft grounds of appeal from Moore J's judgment as formulated by the Sharman applicants, would not be necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">There is considerable force in those submissions of the Music companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">15 The Sharman applicants submitted that Brilliant Digital was distinguishable from the present circumstances because in the former instance, the orders the subject of application for leave to appeal arose from an Anton Piller order that had already been executed, but in the present case, Ms Hemming was yet to be cross-examined and had not, as at the date of hearing of the application, sworn an affidavit for instance on behalf of Sharman Networks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">I should interpolate to record that subsequent to reserving judgment on the question of leave to appeal, the Sharman applicants applied for a stay on Moore J's order requiring Ms Hemming to file that affidavit, and that I refused to grant that stay, but made orders requiring the affidavit to be left in a sealed envelope to be opened only upon further order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Because a Full Court on appeal is in a position to intervene in relation to the subjection of Ms Hemming to Moore J's orders, and because those orders were made, on the Sharman applicants' case, erroneously by his Honour, it was contended by the Sharman applicants to be unjust if leave to appeal was not to be granted in relation to his Honour's orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">16 The Sharman applicants further submitted that the Full Court 'regularly' grants leave to appeal where it can be shown that the exercise of a discretion has miscarried, and where that miscarriage in the exercise of a discretion involves an important question of principle, citing as authority Wong at [22].</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In Wong , the Full Federal Court held that the primary judge had failed to correctly apply the relevant legal test grounding the order made below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">No mention was made by the Full Court of the need to establish 'substantial injustice' before a grant of leave to appeal is to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Counsel for the Music companies submitted in response that Wong was of no assistance, since it was a decision made as a result of the primary judge having ordered the filing of interrogatories in the absence of evidence from the party sought to be interrogated going beyond a 'mere allegation'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">So much was said to stand in contrast with the considerable array of evidence provided respectively to Wilcox, Lindgren and Moore JJ at various interlocutory stages concerning Ms Hemming's control of the Sharman companies and a related and involved trust estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In any event the Music companies submitted that the Court's decision in Wong must be read subject to the later reasons of the Full Court in Brilliant Digital , which required inter alia that 'substantial injustice' be shown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">There is in my opinion clear force in those submissions of the Music companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">17 Contrary moreover to the Music companies' primary submissions, the Sharman applicants contended that should leave to appeal be refused, they would indeed suffer 'substantial injustice'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">That was said to be because the order to cross-examine a deponent of a disclosure affidavit was an exceptional one, and because Moore J had failed correctly to apply the relevant principles in making the order, in that his Honour had not made a positive finding that the affidavit disclosure by Ms Hemming of her own assets was inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">In my opinion however, the reasons of the primary judgment, which I have extracted in [5] above of these reasons are in substance to that effect, or at least sufficiently so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">In any event, the making of an order requiring cross-examination on a disclosure affidavit was said by the Sharman applicants to be tantamount to a finding of contempt, or at least predicated upon such a finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">That latter contention would seem to be directed to an overstatement, in circumstances where the complaint was inadequate responses to the enforcement of orders made ancillary to Mareva relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">18 In support of those propositions of the Sharman applicants, I was taken to several authorities in the United Kingdom and Australia concerned with the making of orders for cross-examination on disclosure affidavits made in pursuit of compliance with a Mareva order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">19 Thus in Den Norske Bank ASA v Antonatos [1999] QB 271, Waller LJ (with whom Chadwick and Millett LJJ agreed) said in a passage at 290, upon which the Sharman applicants placed reliance:
 
 'It is finally important to recognise that it is only in exceptional circumstances that cross-examination will be ordered on an affidavit sworn pursuant to a Mareva order: see House of Spring Gardens Ltd v Waite [1985] FSR 173 at 181, per Slade LJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The anxieties expressed by Scott J in Bayer AG v Winter (No 2) [1986] 1 WLR 540 relating to the court wanting no part of a star chamber process must constantly be borne in mind...' 
 

The passage from the reasons for judgment of Slade LJ in House of Spring Gardens, referred to by Waller LJ above, reads as follows:
 
 
 'I can very well see that on the particular facts of many cases --- perhaps most cases --- the court might not consider it "just and convenient" to order the cross-examination of a defendant who has filed an affidavit in purported compliance with a Mareva order, in a case where the plaintiff has not yet seen fit to issue a motion for contempt and is not seeking an order for the swearing of a second affidavit by the defendant concerned...' 
 

Whether there has occurred 'purported compliance with a Mareva order' must surely be viewed in terms of substance as well as mere form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Lord Justice Slade made those remarks in the course of overruling the decision of Scott J at first instance, which decision had been to the effect that a court did not have the power under s 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (UK) to make an order requiring cross-examination ancillary to compliance with a Mareva order, in the absence of circumstances whereby a justiciable issue is before the Court in respect of which the evidence of the deponent is relevant to the resolution thereof, for instance where the deponent of the disclosure affidavit was the subject of a contempt motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The 'anxieties expressed by Scott J', and also referred to by Waller LJ in Den Norske Bank , appear in Scott J's earlier reasons for judgment in Bayer AG v Winter (No 2) [1986] 1 WLR 540.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">In that latter case, Scott J was concerned with an application seeking orders that the defendant submit to cross-examination on a wide range of matters in aid of earlier Anton Piller and Mareva orders made by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Scott J referred to the scope of the cross-examination contemplated at 543 as follows:
 
 
 'Mr Prescott [for the plaintiff] made clear that the purpose of his proposed cross-examination of the first defendant is a free-ranging one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">He proposes to question him as to the whereabouts of his assets world-wide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">He proposes to question him as to his knowledge of and part played in transactions in counterfeit Baygon wherever they may have happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">' 
 

20 The primary proceedings in Bayer concerned allegations of an organised system for the sale of counterfeit Baygon insecticide products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">As at the time of the hearing before the presiding judge, no statement of claim had been filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Moreover, no evidence proving the allegations of sale of counterfeit Baygon was placed before the presiding judge for the purposes of the application, and at no stage had the defendant had an opportunity to confront any such evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Counsel for the plaintiff had indicated to the presiding judge that pending receipt of certain answers in cross-examination, the plaintiffs were minded subsequently to pursue contempt proceedings against the defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It was in those somewhat extreme circumstances, well removed from the present context here presented that Scott J made the following emphatic statement (at 544) in the course of refusing the order sought for the cross-examination of the defendant, being dictum upon which the Sharman applicants placed reliance in the present context:
 
 'Star Chamber interrogatory procedure has formed no part of the judicial process in this country for several centuries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The proper function of a judge in civil litigation is to decide issues between parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It is not, in my opinion, to preside over an interrogation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">
 
 The police, charged with the upholding of the public law, cannot subject a citizen to cross-examination before a judge in order to discover the truth about the citizen's misdeeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">How then, as a matter of discretion, can it be right in a civil case, in aid of rights which, however important, are merely private rights, to subject a citizen to such a cross-examination?</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">A fortiori it cannot be right to do so in a case where the plaintiff seeking the cross-examination of the defendant is holding itself free to use the defendant's answers for the purpose of an application to commit him to prison for contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">' 
 

I would respectfully withhold from any such somewhat characterisation of the present conduct of the Music companies in their pursuit of what seems to me to be both reasonable and authentic means designed to ensure that Mareva relief is afforded adequate facilitation and implementation in the context of Music companies' intellectual property protection and preservation upheld by the primary judge in the principal litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">
 

21 Senior counsel for the Sharman applicants asserted that nowhere in the reasons for judgment of Moore J is there a finding that the disclosures made by Mr Gee of the assets of the relevant two Sharman companies were incomplete, or that the disclosures by Ms Hemming in her affidavits as to her own assets were incomplete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">I would first observe that any finding of Moore J on the completeness, or otherwise, of Mr Gee's disclosure affidavits could not possibly have any bearing upon the appropriateness of his Honour's order requiring Ms Hemming to attend for cross-examination on her own affidavits, and any suggestion to the contrary is in my opinion incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Moreover, any such conclusion begs the question as to the operation of the notion of 'incomplete', and the context in which it is used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The theme of the primary judge's concern was more in the nature of inadequacy and lack of clarity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Senior counsel for the Sharman applicants asserted that the Music companies had not demonstrated that Ms Hemming's assets included what he termed 'the beneficial interest in the Sharman companies' or that the 'loan transaction with TIL was a sham'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">A present concern of the Music companies is indeed with the beneficial ownership of funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">In the case of tangible and intangible assets subjected to the interposition of a complexity of offshore established companies and trust estates purportedly controlled by an offshore trustee corporation, the task of gaining access to and control of those assets, in order to enforce onshore court judgments and orders, can be an expensive and formidable undertaking for a successful litigant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It was in the light of the complexity and opacity concerning Ms Hemming's apparent employment of a Vanuatu trust instrument that the primary judge observed for the time being as follows at [36]:
 
 '... it is, in my opinion unnecessary for me to resolve some specific issues concerning that structure which were the subject of argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">One was whether [Ms Hemming] has a beneficial interest in the Sharman trust or at least has an interest which should have been identified in her disclosure affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">' 
 

22 Senior counsel for the Sharman applicants submitted that having failed to make a finding on this point, the primary judge appeared to have concluded that the power to order cross-examination should be exercised in order to allow the matter of any such beneficial ownership to be further explored, his Honour observing in that context at [36]:
 
 'If this issue [was] explored in cross-examination then the Court will be left with a greater measure of certainty about whether she does [have an interest in the Sharman companies per medium of the Sharman trust].</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">' 
 

23 In further response to the primary judge's endeavours to distil an expedient means for the ascertainment relevantly of beneficial ownership, it was contended by the Sharman applicants that in circumstances such as the present, an order for cross-examination of a deponent 'cannot be made unless the Court is affirmatively satisfied that there has been a non-disclosure', all that being said to have involved 'a resolution of the arguments expressly eschewed by Moore J in [36] [of his reasons]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">I have difficulty with that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">In the context of his Honour's review of some of the offshore as well as onshore transactions, his Honour had made the significant finding, along the way as it were, that the 'evidence ... suggest[s] a loan was made after the property was purchased...' and also that 'a loan was not secured by a mortgage'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Consequently his Honour was able to observe at [37] that '... real doubts arise about, and uncertainty surrounds, the reason why this transaction took place when it did, and whether the moneys transferred to TIL were, in truth, in satisfaction of a loan or continues to constitute an asset of, and requires disclosure by, [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">' In the circumstances I have thus far recorded, that was an apposite observation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">24 All that was referrable of course to the implications of the payment of $1,116,405.63 by Ms Hemming to TIL, following the sale of her Sydney residence on 4 February 2005; that payment appears to have been made out of the proceeds of a sale of that residence, which was effected for the gross price of $2,100,000 to a person identified by the evidence as an accountant of certain of the Sharman companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">There was no sufficiently detailed or otherwise cogent evidence as to who exercised the substantial or underlying control of decision making of TIL, or as to the basis of or reasons for such alleged indebtedness having crystallised in the first place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The state of the evidence as to the control of TIL was itself the subject of disputation before Moore J and senior counsel for the Sharman applicants sought to attribute error to his Honour's judgment for the further reason that he had failed to make a finding as to Ms Hemming's control, or otherwise, of that entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The Sharman applicants postulated that the 'remark' made by Lindgren J at [13] of his Honour's reasons for judgment in Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 that '[Wilcox J] accepted [in the course of granting the Mareva relief on 22 March 2005] that the Sharman Companies were controlled by Ms Hemming by reason of a "client services agreement" between her and TIL dated 8 April 2002' was an 'unsure foundation for any finding of control of the Sharman trust or the Sharman companies [by Ms Hemming]', and was thus inappropriately or impermissibly relied upon by Moore J in formulating his reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">That submission lacked merit, particularly in the light of [31] of Lindgren J's reasons for judgment in which his Honour paraphrased the two-fold acceptance, given in cross-examination by the solicitor acting for Sharman License and Sharman Networks in their application before Lindgren J, that TIL as trustee of the Sharman trust was the ultimate beneficial owner of all the shares issued in Sharman License and Sharman Networks, and moreover that Wilcox J had himself appeared to accept that in consequence of the client services agreement, Ms Hemming 'controlled the Sharman trust'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">25 The Music companies had submitted to Moore J that given the evidentiary shortcomings on a subject readily susceptible to documentary demonstration, inclusive of banking records I might add, there was in truth and reality no antecedent loan, that the transfer of those funds by Ms Hemming to TIL in Vanuatu constituted a sham transaction, and consequently that those monies remained her own property beneficially, and should have been identified and disclosed as such in her affidavit provided in the Mareva context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Once more, so it was asserted by the Sharman applicants, his Honour declined to make any concluded finding on the subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The point is however that his Honour had been able to infer from the surrounding circumstances I have already outlined that there was some force in the Music companies' submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">But in any event his Honour was of the view that he could permit cross-examination of Ms Hemming on and in relation to those matters because at least doubt existed in relation to that area of enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">26 In respect of that finding, the Sharman applicants referred to Moore J's rationale expressed at [37] of his reasons for judgment and emphasised it as is indicated in non-italics:
 
 'Greater clarity about this matter [being the transfer of funds to TIL on 4 February 2005] may arise from the cross-examination of [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">' 
 

From what I have already reviewed, there was ample justification for his Honour to have reached that view of the unusual transactional offshore circumstances in evidence before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It was submitted however on behalf of the Sharman applicants that so much did not imply that Moore J was satisfied that there had not been compliance with the order of the court to disclose assets by Ms Hemming, which affirmative finding was of course contended by the Sharman applicants to be a prerequisite to the making of an order for cross-examination; I was referred for comparison to Planet International v Garcia (No 2) (1991) 1 Qd R 426, where the following appears at 427 of Thomas J's reasons for judgment:
 
 
 
 'In the present case I am satisfied Mr Garcia has not adequately complied with the order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">On the material before me, he has provided a collection of some untruthful statements, non-disclosures and qualifications...' 
 

I was also referred, by way of further comparison, to the following observations of the Court of Appeal in England in Motorola Credit Corporation v Uzan (No 2) [2003] EWCA Civ 752 ; [2004] 1 WLR 113 at [147] :
 
 
 'The piecemeal, late, untruthful and manifestly incomplete disclosure which the defendants gave amply justified the view that cross-examination was just and convenient because it might reveal assets which would make the freezing order more effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">' 
 

But of course those respective findings related to differing matters and circumstances, and neither finding was intended to be definitively exemplary, such as to exclude the need for further exploration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">
 

27 My reading of his Honour's reasons here was that he was far from satisfied with the nature or extent of the purported offshore structures and transactions to the extent apparent from the evidence, involving as they did the creation of a trust estate somewhat cognate to what have often been described as 'blind trusts'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Concerns of that nature appear to have persuaded or assisted to persuade the primary judge of the need to order that Ms Hemming submit to cross-examination on her disclosure affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">In determining to take that approach, his Honour paid regard to the relevant authorities dealing with both the grant of Mareva relief, and the making of orders ancillary to the same, including orders requiring the swearing of disclosure affidavits and cross-examination on those affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">After reviewing the relevant principles enunciated in those authorities, his Honour concluded at [28]: 
 
 '...ultimately the cautionary words of the four members of the High Court in [ Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380 at 403-404] set out at [18] above must be heeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Orders made in the Court's ancillary jurisdiction must be founded on a doctrinal and principled basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">A Mareva order is protective of the Court's processes, including the efficacy of execution of those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Orders concerning disclosure affidavits and cross examination can, in turn, be made to render the Mareva order more efficacious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">This is the touchstone for determining whether leave should be given to cross examine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">A relevant consideration in determining whether leave should be given might, in an appropriate case, be the failure of the deponent of a disclosure affidavit to disclose assets completely or promptly or both.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">In such a case, leave might be given because doubts might arise about whether the deponent had understood and accepted the obligations and burdens imposed by the Mareva order and the ancillary order requiring the disclosure affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Cross examination might be appropriate to test whether the disclosure affidavits fully revealed all assets on which the Mareva order operated and which might be available to satisfy any judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">However, in other cases, other more significant factors might support the granting of leave to cross examine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">' 
 

The 'cautionary words' of the High Court in Cardile earlier extracted by his Honour at [18] of his reasons below referred to the need for courts to exercise caution in making Mareva orders and to only do so upon a principled basis, having regard to the impact that those orders may have on respondents and third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">
 

28 It was submitted nevertheless on behalf of the Sharman applicants that the premise upon which the application for an order for cross-examination order proceeded here was that Ms Hemming had breached the order requiring her to disclose her assets, and that the basis upon which the Music companies litigated the proceedings below was to seek to convince the primary judge that there had occurred inadequate disclosure, on the footing that Ms Hemming did have a substantial asset, namely beneficial interests in the Sharman companies, and further that the loan transaction with TIL was in truth a sham arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Those issues were to have been debated before his Honour at length below 'but were never resolved'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Certainly the premise upon which the order is sought, as I have already sought to explain, was an inadequacy of disclosure of such matters in circumstances that indicated the need for further exploration and inquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">29 It was next asserted by the Sharman applicants that the high point of his Honour's conclusion below, both as to the so-called 'putative ownership by Ms Hemming of the Sharman Trust' and as to 'the existence or otherwise of the loan made by TIL to Ms Hemming repaid in February 2005', was that there was 'a lack of clarity' about the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">My observation is however, that any such lack of clarity about the alleged loan and its repayment or partial repayment derives from its inherently commercially, inexplicable origins and purposes in the first place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">It was submitted therefore to be an unprincipled exercise of discretion for his Honour to have ordered cross-examination in circumstances where the Music companies had not convinced his Honour upon either of those conditions which they had raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">In truth, so the submissions continued, his Honour fell into the error of making an order for cross-examination in circumstances where no basis had been demonstrated to the Court to make such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">For reasons I have already ventured, the concerns relevantly expressed by his Honour were more than some mere 'lack of clarity'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">30 In conclusion therefore, it was the case of the Sharman applicants that Moore J failed correctly to apply the relevant legal principles in committing Ms Hemming to cross-examination on her disclosure affidavit, and that it must follow that the Sharman applicants would inherently suffer 'substantial injustice' if Ms Hemming be so required to submit to cross-examination in accordance with the relief granted by the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In short, the complaint was that Moore J gave leave for the cross-examination to take place because the Court might 'be left with a greater measure of certainty' [36], and further 'because cross-examination may lead to greater clarity' [37], and that so much exemplified errors in principle in the exercise of his discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Conclusions upon the principal matters raised 
 
31 In my opinion, and for the reasons I have largely foreshadowed in my observations upon the submissions already recorded, the application for leave to appeal brought by the Sharman applicants has not sufficient cogency to justify the grant of any such leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The case of the Music companies presented to the primary judge (Moore J) for relief of the nature and to the extent granted was sufficiently in line with established principle as to be clear from 'sufficient doubt'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">I do not think that the United Kingdom and Australian authorities establish inflexible requirements to the extent postulated by the Sharman applicants, in particular concerning the Court's jurisdiction to grant leave to cross-examine the deponents of disclosure affidavits in Mareva contexts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">His Honour's approach in particular to the issue of granting leave to the Music companies to cross-examine Ms Hemming was soundly justified in the light of the evidentiary circumstances concerning the Sharman applicants' offshore trust structure, and the circumstances of and context in which such a substantial sum of money was transferred to an offshore company in the amount and in the context that occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">32 It is readily apparent that the primary judge placed significant weight, and I think rightly so, upon the following findings made by Lindgren J in the context of the preceding interlocutory proceedings of Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 , being proceedings which I have referred to earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">At [15] of his reasons for judgment, Lindgren J observed as follows:
 
 'As noted earlier, the Sharman Companies were ultimately beneficially owned by TIL as trustee of the Sharman Trust, and, notwithstanding the reference to "discretion" and the right of termination, the client services agreement provided evidence before his Honour that TIL, including TIL as trustee of the Sharman Trust, was likely to act at the direction of Ms Hemming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Since TIL, as trustee of the Sharman Trust was the ultimate beneficial owner of all the issued shares in the Sharman Companies, there was evidence before his Honour to show that they were also likely to act at her direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">' 
 

Earlier, at [4], his Honour had observed:
 
 
 'On 4 February 2005, Ms Hemming and Richard Kilmer-Barber settled a sale of their home at Castle Cove in Sydney to John Simon Myers for $2,100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Title was transferred on 16 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Ms Hemming and Dr Kilmer-Barber continued to occupy the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Ms Hemming's interest in the home was apparently her only substantial asset within the jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">There was evidence before his Honour that Mr Myers occupied some role such as accountant or bookkeeper of the Sharman Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Ms Hemming was the Chief Executive Officer of the Sharman Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Out of the proceeds of sale, $1,116,405.63 was transferred to a bank account in Vanuatu... which is where the Sharman Companies are incorporated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">' 
 

33 After reviewing in some detail the Australian authorities relating to misuse or abuse of process and of Mareva orders, and also the evidence placed before him in the present segment of the proceedings, in particular that concerned with Ms Hemming's apparent control of Sharman Networks, and Wilcox J's conclusions thereon, Moore J expressed his satisfaction that Ms Hemming should be required to swear a disclosure affidavit in relation to Sharman Network's assets, largely for the reasons I have already canvassed and which I will reproduce below, the same having been the focus of much of the respective parties submissions made in the present interlocutory proceedings (at [36] and [37]):
 
 'This leads to a consideration of whether [Ms Hemming] should be cross examined on her affidavits concerning disclosure of her assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">In my opinion, such an order should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The evidence points clearly to the structure reflected in the Sharman trust and the arrangements in Vanuatu more generally, having been established by [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Counsel for the applicants described that structure as opaque.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">This is in an apt description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">However, it is, in my opinion, unnecessary for me to resolve some specific issues concerning that structure which were the subject of argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">One was whether the fourth respondent has a beneficial interest in the Sharman trust or at least has an interest which should have been identified in her disclosure affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Not only is the evidence on this issue likely to be incomplete ([Ms Hemming] has proffered no evidence and almost certainly the applicants do not have all relevant records - they do not even have the trust deed) but it is also by no means clear to me how the law of Vanuatu would operate on the arrangements revealed, to this point, by the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">It would be unsatisfactory, dealing with the type of issues presently under consideration, to proceed on the basis that the law in that country can be presumed to be the same as the law of Australia: see The Parchim [1918] AC 157 at 161.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The findings of Wilcox J... point towards a conclusion that she does have such an interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">If this issue is explored in cross examination then the Court will be left with a greater measure of certainty about whether she does.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">
 
 The transfer of the property by [Ms Hemming] to another... has several unusual features.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">It occurred at a time when final submissions were being made in the primary proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Registration of the transfer occurred five days after the applicant's final submissions were served on the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">One can infer that the strengths and weaknesses of the respective cases would have been apparent to the parties and those advising them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The transferee was to a person associated with [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">He was an accountant who had work [sic] for the Sharman companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">A significant part of the proceeds of the sale were paid to [TIL]...</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">This was in settlement of what was said to be a loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">While some of the documents in evidence can be viewed as supporting the existence of a loan, they nonetheless suggest a loan was made after the property was purchased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">That, itself, is unusual, though one must accept there may be an explanation for this including, as counsel for [Ms Hemming] pointed out, that the funds lent replaced bridging finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">But the evidence suggests that a loan was not secured by a mortgage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In all, real doubts arise about, and uncertainty surrounds, the reason why this transaction took place when it did and whether the moneys transferred to TIL were, in truth, in satisfaction of a loan or continues to constitute an asset of, and requires disclosure by, [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Greater clarity about this matter may arise from the cross examination of [Ms Hemming].</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">' 
 

34 With respect to the carefully as well as forcefully presented submissions made to the Court by senior counsel for the Sharman applicants, I am unable to distil material or significant error in the approach of the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">It was readily to be inferred by the primary judge, from the material placed before his Honour, that Ms Hemming did exercise what his Honour described as a central role in relation to the business of Sharman Networks, and moreover that Mr Gee, who was put forward by the Sharman applicants as having performed that role, was '... only in form an appropriate person' to have provided the principal affidavit evidence on behalf of the Sharman companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">I have not found the observations appearing in the English authorities, to which I have been referred by the Sharman applicants, and which I have extracted, to be of assistance, at least in contextual circumstances such as here involved, where the Sharman applicants have resorted to offshore transactions bearing no evident commercial significance, at least of transparency, and did so, in part, co-incidentally upon the unsuccessful involvement of the Sharman parties and their entities in the very substantial Universal Music litigation which concluded on the question of liability on 5 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">At least in circumstances such as those, the description 'Star Chamber interrogatory procedures' is inapposite.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Moreover in line with the observations made in Brilliant Digital , the orders here complained of are in substance at least presently concerned with 'matters of practice and procedure', and not 'substantive interests of the parties'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">35 Largely upon the footing of the foregoing findings, and his Honour's further findings as to the Sharman companies' principal deponent of affidavit evidence (being Mr Gee) having been '... only in form an appropriate person', though not in substance, and instead his having been essentially 'a cipher', I am unable to accept otherwise than that the primary judge was correct in his view that '[i]t is not possible to be affirmatively satisfied that [the disclosure]... is now complete', and further, in pointing out that Mr Myers' testimony did '... not provide sufficient assurance that Mr Gee's affidavits can, on their face, be accepted as constituting a full disclosure'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">36 In the light of my preceding discussion and analysis I also think that his Honour was right to have concluded in the following terms at [39] in the course of rejecting the Sharman applicants' contention that the subjection of Ms Hemming to cross-examination amounted to an abuse of the Court's process:
 
 'I accept that the [Music companies] would wish to ascertain who are the real and effective controllers of the Sharman companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">I also accept that this may become a matter about which questions might be asked if the orders sought by the applicants are made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">However if that becomes a legitimate area of cross examination (bearing in mind that any cross examination will be subject to the control of the Court) it will be for a legitimate purpose and not an illegitimate and collateral one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">I do not accept the criticisms of the way the [Music companies] identified and characterised the breaches of the disclosure order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">In particular, [Sharman License and Sharman Networks] elected to provide the disclosure affidavits required of them from a person appropriate in form but not in substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The [Music companies], who necessarily cannot be certain from their own knowledge of the matters to which the disclosure affidavits related, were entitled to review critically the affidavits proffered by [those Sharman companies].</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">All the more so given the opaque structure reflected in the Sharman trust and the arrangements in Vanuatu more generally and referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">While some of the criticisms were not significant, they included the failure to disclose significant sums held by lawyers on trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">I am not satisfied that the application should be dismissed for the reasons advanced by the [Sharman applicants].</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">' 
 

37 In making order 3 on 17 November 2005, it was submitted that Moore J also fell into error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The effect of order 3 was said to extend the 'freezing order' to the assets of Sharman Licence, which was erroneous because his Honour had overlooked the implications of the circumstance that Wilcox J had found in the main proceedings that such company had been completely successful and the claims made against it had been wholly dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Thus at [40], his Honour held as follows:
 
 'In view of (Wilcox J's) conclusions concerning the liability of [Sharman License], no such order should be made concerning that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">' 
 

It was apparently common ground moreover that Sharman Licence was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sharman Networks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">So much was said by the Sharman parties to have been 'entirely overlooked' when his Honour concluded at [40] of his reasons as follows:
 
 
 '... the proposed order is intended to bind existing respondents and prohibiting them from "causing or permitting any wholly-owned subsidiary" from dealing with its assets subject to the exceptions in the order as originally formulated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">This appears to me to be an appropriate extension of the original Mareva order and will ensure that assets of the respondents held, indirectly, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, will be controlled in the same way and for the same purpose as assets directly held to which the Mareva order presently applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">' 
 

I am unable however to comprehend why Sharman License's subsidiary status in relation to Sharman Networks should exclude it from the operation of the order of the Court below, which understandably was so framed as to extend to 'any wholly owned subsidiary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">' As pointed out by the Music companies, such an order does not have the effect of extending the Mareva order to Sharman License's assets, per se , but rather, the order prevents 'Sharman Networks from causing its subsidiaries to dispose of their assets'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">38 In the result, I am of the opinion that the application of the Sharman parties for leave to appeal addressed in these reasons must be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.</sentence>

 The nature of the proceeding 
 

 
 1 The principal issue in this proceeding is whether the Victorian Arts Centre falls within the category of 'premises of State Government Departments and Instrumentalities', for the purposes of provisions in industrial awards relating to rates of payment for persons employed in cleaning those premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In turn, this depends upon whether the Victorian Arts Centre Trust, a statutory corporation established by the Victorian Arts Centre Act 1979 (Vic) ('the VAC Act'), is properly described as a State Government department or instrumentality, for the purposes of the award provisions.</sentence>

 2 The applicant seeks penalties, pursuant to s 178 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the WR Act') for breaches of the terms of two awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The first award is the Building Services (Victoria) Award 1994 ('the 1994 Award').</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The second is the Building Services (Victoria) Award 2003 ('the 2003 Award').</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In each case, the respondent is alleged to have failed to pay named employees amounts it was required to pay by a specified clause of the award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The applicant seeks an order, pursuant to s 178(6) of the WR Act, that the respondent pay to each of those employees the amount owing to him or her.</sentence>

 The Victorian Arts Centre Trust 
 

 
 10 The legislative history of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust ('the Trust') goes back at least to the National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Act 1956 (Vic) ('the 1956 Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The preamble to the 1956 Act recited that a power to reserve certain land as a site for a National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre had been given to the Governor-in-Council under the Melbourne South Land Act 1946 (Vic), and that it was expedient to make provision for the vesting of such land in a committee constituted for the purpose of raising funds and providing a suitable building on such site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Section 3(1) of the 1956 Act provided: 


 
 'For the purposes of raising funds for the erection of a suitable building on the land reserved under the Principal Act and for the erection of such a building on such land there shall be a committee which committee shall be a body corporate under the name of the " National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Building Committee " with perpetual succession and a common seal and shall be capable in law of suing and being sued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">' 
 
 
 11 Section 5 provided for the grant to the National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Building Committee ('the Building Committee') of land reserved as a site for a National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Section 8 made provision for part of the land concerned to be used as a road, without such use operating to dedicate it as a public highway, and for part of the land to be used for ornamental purposes, for which the City of Melbourne was to have responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Section 9(1) provided that the Building Committee would be entitled to the rents and profits of any land granted to it by the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">


 
 12 The 1956 Act was amended by Act No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">6522 of 1959.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The amendments included the insertion among the powers of the Building Committee of the power to borrow on terms and conditions approved by the Treasurer of Victoria and the addition of a power, granted to the Treasurer of Victoria, to guarantee the repayment of any sum borrowed by the Building Committee with the Treasurer's approval and any interest on such sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">


 
 13 By s 12(1)(b) of Act No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">8249 of 1972, the Building Committee was renamed the Victorian Arts Centre Building Committee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">


 
 14 The Trust was established by the VAC Act, which came into operation on 13 March 1980.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Section 4 provided: 


 
 '(1) There shall be established a body corporate by the name of the 
 Victorian Arts Centre Trust which shall have perpetual succession and 
 a common seal and shall be capable in law of suing and of being sued 
 and of taking purchasing holding demising selling transferring 
 conveying mortgaging or otherwise disposing of real and personal 
 property for the purposes of and subject to this Act and of being and 
 suffering all acts matters and things which bodies corporate may by 
 law do and suffer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 
 (2) Subject to the general direction and control of the Minister the Trust 
 shall be responsible for the management of the Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">' 
 
 
 15 The word 'Centre' is defined in s 3 of the VAC Act as including the relevant land, and the buildings and improvements erected on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">By s 2(a) and (b) of the VAC Act, the Building Committee went out of office on the day on which the VAC Act came into operation, and the Trust became its successor in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">By s 2(d) of the VAC Act, all property vested in the Building Committee became vested in the Trust on that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">


 
 16 The functions of the Trust are set out in s 5 of the VAC Act: 


 
 '(1) The functions of the Trust are&#8722; 
 
 (a) to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain 
 the Centre; and 
 
 (b) to present and produce theatrical performances, operas, plays, 
 dramas, ballets and musical and other performances and 
 entertainment of any kind at any place; and 
 
 (c) to promote the use of the theatres, concert hall and other 
 places of assembly by suitable persons and bodies; and 
 
 (d) to provide leadership in the promotion and development of the 
 performing arts; and 
 
 (e) to ensure the maintenance, conservation, development and 
 promotion of the State collection of performing arts material; 
 and 
 
 (f) to oversee the exhibition of performing arts material from the 
 State collection and make any performing arts material from 
 the State collection available on loan to persons or institutions; 
 and 
 
 (fa) to establish, maintain, conserve, develop, promote and exhibit 
 the public art collection; and 
 
 (fb) to make any object from the public art collection available for 
 study or loan to persons or institutions, subject to any 
 conditions that the Trust determines; and 
 
 (g) to carry on, whether within or outside Victoria, whether alone 
 or in association with any other person or persons and whether 
 or not in relation to the Centre, a business of providing 
 ticketing, inventory management of admissions, marketing and 
 related services; and 
 
 (h) to perform any other functions appropriate to the Centre as the 
 Minister may approve; and 
 
 (i) to carry out any other function conferred on the Trust under 
 this Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 (2) In carrying out its functions, the Trust must endeavour to contribute to 
 the enrichment of the cultural, educational, social and economic life of 
 the people of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">' 
 
 
 17 The powers of the Trust, conferred by s 6 of the VAC Act, are the sorts of powers ordinarily conferred on a statutory corporation, with the addition of some that might be considered unusual for a government body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">For example, s 6(2) confers on the Trust the following powers: 


 
 '(e) to apply for and hold any licence or permit under the Liquor Control 
 Reform Act 1998 or any other Act; 
 
 (f) to register, purchase or apply for or otherwise acquire either wholly 
 or in part any invention, copyright, trade-mark or other mark or 
 design, patent, patent rights and privileges, licences, concessions or 
 other like rights which in the opinion of the Trust will be of assistance 
 to the Trust in carrying out its functions and to sell, dispose of, use, 
 exercise and develop such rights or inventions or to grant licences or 
 privileges in respect thereof; 
 
 ... 
 
 (h) to install, use, work and maintain film cameras and projectors and 
 broadcasting and television apparatus, and to grant the right of 
 installing, using, working and maintaining the same within the areas 
 under its control upon such terms and conditions and subject to the 
 payment of such charges as may be determined by the Trust; 
 
 (i) to print or reproduce in any manner or form and to publish or to 
 arrange for the printing or reproduction or publishing of plays, music, 
 programmes, posters and advertisements and such other material as 
 the Trust may deem expedient and to acquire the copyright therein; 
 
 (j) to commission plays, compositions, musicals, ballets, operas or other 
 works;' 
 
 
 18 The Trust's borrowing powers, conferred by s 7 of the VAC Act, are confined to borrowing with the approval of the Treasurer and subject to such terms, conditions and limits as the Treasurer imposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Treasurer has power, given by s 7(3), to guarantee repayment and the payment of interest, charges and expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">


 
 19 By amendment to the VAC Act in 2000, s 14(4) provides that a person employed by the Trust is not, in respect of that employment, subject to the provisions of the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Vic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Also by later amendment, ss 3A and 3B of the VAC Act provide that the Trust has vested in it collections of performing arts material and artworks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">By s 18 of the VAC Act, the Trust may not sell or dispose of any item that is part of those collections without advertising its intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">If any objection is received, the decision whether to sell is one for the Minister, or a delegate of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">By amendment of the VAC Act in 1994, s 18A was inserted, to give the Trust power to make by-laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">


 
 20 It may be relevant to observe how the Trust sees itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In its annual report for 2003-2004, the Trust described itself as follows: 


 
 'Purpose and statutory functions 
 
 The core purpose of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust (the Trust) is to enrich the lives of Victorians --- culturally, educationally, socially and economically 
 ( Victorian Arts Centre Act 1979 Section 5 ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 The Trust's responsibilities include: 
 
 &#8226; to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Arts 
 Centre; 
 
 &#8226; to produce and present theatrical performances of any kind; 
 
 &#8226; to promote the use of the Arts Centre by the community; 
 
 &#8226; to ensure the maintenance, conservation, development, promotion 
 and exhibition of the State collection of performing arts materials 
 and the public art collection, as well as making material available 
 for study or loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 Our role 
 
 &#8226; providing leadership in the creation, presentation, promotion and 
 advocacy of the performing arts; 
 
 &#8226; stimulating curiosity and understanding of the performing arts; 

 &#8226; increasing accessibility and enjoyment of the performing arts; 

 &#8226; creating partnerships that increase the value and potential of the 
 performing arts; 
 
 &#8226; exercising responsible care and presentation of publicly owned 
 cultural assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 Our vision 
 
 Our vision is of a society that values the performing arts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">' 
 
 
 21 In two places on its web site, the Trust describes itself as: 


 
 'a statutory authority of the Arts Portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Arts Portfolio is 
 administered by Arts Victoria, a division of the Department of Premier 
 and Cabinet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">' 
 
 
 22 Further, on its web page, the Trust says: 


 
 'The Arts Centre is the flagship of the performing arts in Victoria, and the focal point of Melbourne's cultural precinct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The Arts Centre is owned by the people of Victoria, and we welcome people at large to experience all that the Arts Centre has to offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
 In assocciation [ sic ] with some of Australia's top performing arts companies, and an array of national and international companies, we present a unique diversity of arts and entertainment choices all year round.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Arts Centre also offers eating and exhibitions to appeal to every age, taste and budget.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">' 
 
 
 23 The Arts Victoria Act 1972 (Vic) creates the office of Director, Arts Victoria, and provides for the appointment of a body called the Victorian Council of the Arts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Section 4 of that Act provides, in relation to the Department of Premier and Cabinet: 


 
 'The objects of the Department under this Act are&#8722; 
 
 (a) to develop and improve the knowledge understanding appreciation 
 and practice of the Arts in Victoria; 
 
 (b) to increase the availability and accessibility of the Arts to the public of 
 Victoria; 
 
 (c) to encourage and assist in the provision of facilities to enable the Arts 
 to be performed or displayed; 
 
 (d) to continually survey and assess the position of the Arts in Victoria 
 and to report to the Parliament at least once in every year on the 
 condition of the Arts in Victoria and to suggest ways in which the Arts 
 may be further and better assisted; 
 
 (e) to administer the Acts and enactments for which the Minister is 
 responsible; 
 
 (f) to advise and co-operate with other Departments of the Government 
 public statutory authorities municipalities and other persons or bodies 
 concerned with the promotion or practice of the Arts in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">' 
 
 
 24 It is clear that the Trust is not a State Government department, for the purposes of the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in the award clauses with which this case is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">There is a clear contrast between the Trust and Arts Victoria, which is described as a division of what is undoubtedly a State Government department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The test for determining whether a particular body is an 'instrumentality' of a State, within the ordinary meaning of that term, is found in Re Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria; Ex parte State Public Services Federation [1992] HCA 53 ; (1992) 175 CLR 442 at 448, where the High Court said: 


 
 'It is well settled that union eligibility rules are to be interpreted liberally and according to their ordinary and popular meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">However, the expression "State instrumentality" is one that carries much the same meaning in popular usage as in a legal context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">That meaning directs attention to the purpose or end served, so that a body is a State instrumentality if it is empowered to and does, in fact, serve some State government purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">And that is so even if it is neither a servant nor an agent of the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">' [Footnotes omitted]
 
 
 25 Among the authorities cited for the central proposition is the passage in the judgment of Isaacs and Rich JJ in Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees' Union of Australia v Melbourne Corporation [1919] HCA 72 ; (1919) 26 CLR 508 at 530---531, where their Honours said: 


 
 'If a municipality either (1) is legally empowered to perform and does perform any function whatever for the Crown, or (2) is lawfully empowered to perform and does perform any function which constitutionally is inalienably a Crown function &#8722; as, for instance, the administration of justice &#8722; the municipality is in law presumed to represent the Crown, and the exemption applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Otherwise, it is outside that exemption, and, if impliedly exempted at all, some other principle must be resorted to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The making and maintenance of streets in the municipality is not within either proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">' 
 
 
 26 In the Anti-Cancer Council case, the court held that the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria ('the ACCV') was not a 'State instrumentality', within the meaning of that expression in a trade union's eligibility rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The ACCV was not under ministerial control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Its only function that might have been described as serving a State Government purpose was the receipt of reports and the keeping and compiling of a register, for which the ACCV received a small amount of government funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Significantly, there was no obligation imposed on the ACCV with respect to the reports it received or the cancer register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The court held that the ACCV fell within another limb of the rule of the trade union in question, which defined those eligible for membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">


 
 27 Counsel for the respondent relied on R v Industrial Court of South Australia; Ex parte Australian Broadcasting Commission (1976) 13 SASR 460.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia held that the Australian Broadcasting Commission ('the ABC') was not an 'instrumentality or agency of the Government of the Commonwealth', within the meaning of s 114 of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1972---1975 (SA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">At 284, Bray CJ, with whom Hogarth J agreed, referred to Electricity Trust of South Australia v Linterns Ltd [1950] SASR 133, in which it was held that the Electricity Trust of South Australia was a government instrumentality, as it managed the undertaking for the supply of electricity and the mining of coal in South Australia, exercised its functions on behalf of the Crown, and was the means or agency for managing a Crown asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">At 284---285, Bray CJ conceded that the ABC might be regarded as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, but expressed the view that it could not be regarded as an instrumentality of the 'Government' of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">His Honour took the view that the word 'Government', with a capital initial, in s 114 meant the executive government of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">At 285, his Honour examined various provisions of the statute creating the ABC, emphasising the degree of autonomy from the executive government enjoyed by the ABC (with ministerial control only over a small number of specified functions, or in some exceptional specified circumstances), and the obligation of the ABC to indemnify the Postmaster-General in respect of any claim for anything done by the Postmaster-General's Department at the request of the ABC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">His Honour also pointed out that there was nothing in the statute declaring that the ABC held its assets on behalf of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">At 285---286, Bray CJ also regarded as relevant the question whether the degree of ministerial control was sufficient to entitle the ABC to the shield of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Assuming it to have been decided correctly, the ABC case is readily distinguishable from the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">


 
 28 In the present case, one of the most striking features of the Trust is the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">By s 4(2) of the VAC Act, the Trust's management of the Victorian Arts Centre is expressly subject to the general direction and control of the relevant Minister of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The Trust can only perform functions outside those expressly conferred by s 5(1) if the Minister approves of such functions (see s5(1)(h)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The exercise of the Trust's borrowing power is only possible with the approval of the Treasurer, under s 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The extent of ministerial control is such that the Trust would be very likely to have the benefit of the immunity of the Crown from the application of legislation not expressed to bind the Crown, or from being sued or convicted of a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In determining whether a statutory authority has such immunity, the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control under its establishing legislation is of great importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">See Superannuation Fund Investment Trust v Commissioner of Stamps (SA) [1979] HCA 34 ; (1979) 145 CLR 330 at 347---350 per Stephen J, and State Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia [1986] HCA 62 ; (1986) 161 CLR 639 at 650.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">


 
 29 The first function of the Trust, listed in s 5(1) of the VAC Act, is to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The land and buildings comprising the Victorian Arts Centre are vested in the Trust, by virtue of s 2(d) of the VAC Act, and by virtue of the vesting of what was formerly Crown land in the Trust's predecessor, the Building Committee, by the 1956 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">


 
 30 The legislative history, and the terms of the VAC Act, suggest strongly that the principal purpose for the Trust's existence is to hold the title to, and to manage, a major public asset on behalf of the Crown in right of the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">That this is the purpose of the VAC Act is confirmed by reference to the speech of the Minister for the Arts upon the second reading of the bill that became the VAC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In the course of that speech, the Minister said: 


 
 'The Government's investment in the project to date has been substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Its commitment to it has been a strong one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">This Bill provides a means of protecting that investment by establishing an operating style that is flexible, business-like and expressly designed for the needs of a major performing arts centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The centre is not just a set of buildings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">' 
 
 
 31 This extract from the second reading speech also suggests that the powers to which I have referred in [17], which I have described as unusual for a government body, have been conferred on the Trust as a means of enabling the better performance by the Trust of its principal function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The unusual powers enable the Trust to act as an impresario and a promoter, so that it can do all that might be thought necessary to manage effectively the important public asset vested in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">When viewed in this way, the unusual powers do not detract from the Trust's otherwise clear status as a government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Further, the removal of the employees of the Trust from the area of operation of the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Vic), by s 14(4) of the VAC Act, is seen simply as a means of achieving the degree of flexibility thought to be necessary for the Trust to exercise its range of powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Again, it should not be thought that such flexibility is necessarily inconsistent with the Trust being a government instrumentality, especially when it is viewed in the light of the ancillary nature of the unusual powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">


 
 32 Another significant indicator that the Trust is established to serve a government purpose is the grant to it, by s 18A of the VAC Act of the power to make by-laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The delegation of legislative power suggests that the Trust carries on governmental activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">See State Bank of New South Wales at 651.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">


 
 33 The examination of the legislative history, and of the current state of the VAC Act, makes it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Trust is both empowered to serve, and does serve a State Government purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">That purpose is the control and management of a significant public asset, which successive governments of Victoria have wished to make available for the economic and cultural enrichment of the citizens of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The information on the Trust's web site confirms this view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The Trust therefore falls clearly within the ordinary meaning of the phrase 'State instrumentality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">


 
 34 Counsel for the respondent submitted that the expression 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award should not bear its ordinary meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">His submissions were based on the history of the making of the two awards and the circumstances surrounding them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">He also advanced a number of other arguments about the construction of the relevant provisions, including the argument that a purposive construction of them should be adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 The history and context of the awards 
 

 
 35 Prior to 1992, terms and conditions of employment in the contract cleaning industry in Victoria were regulated pursuant to Victorian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">By that time, there were two main awards regulating the contract cleaning industry, the Building Services Award and the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">


 
 36 In or about 1992, the Victorian Government began to contract out the cleaning of government premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">As a consequence, the applicant or one of its predecessor unions applied to the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria to vary the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The variation sought was the insertion of a clause that would ensure that the conditions in that Award, which were superior to those in the Building Services Award , would continue to be available to employees cleaning government premises in Victoria, although those employees were employed by contractors and not by the State of Victoria itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">On 21 September 1992, Commissioner Pimm made an order, inserting into the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award a new clause, designated as cl 1A Incidence of Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">So far as is relevant to this proceeding, that clause provided: 


 
 'The Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award applies to the whole of the State of Victoria for persons engaged in the provision of building services in the occupations of building attendant, caretaker, cleaner, lift attendant or security officer, howsoever designated, employed --- 
 
 (a) By a contractor engaged by a State Government Department or 
 Instrumentality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">
 
 
 37 On 29 October 1992, when the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria in full session made a new Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award , to supersede the former award of that name, this incidence clause appeared in Pt A of that award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">


 
 38 Counsel for the respondent contended that, both before and after the insertion of the incidence of award clause, cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre were employed by a contractor and were not paid any allowance referable to the Trust being a government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">He contended that the purpose of the incidence of award clause was solely to ensure that superior terms and conditions of employment enjoyed by cleaners employed by the State of Victoria continued to apply when the State contracted out the cleaning of its premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">


 
 39 Not long after October 1992, there was a substantial flight from Victorian state awards to federal awards, as unions attempted to avoid new Victorian legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The applicant attempted to obtain a federal award for cleaners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Employers in the industry opposed this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Although the applicant was successful in overcoming an objection that the Commission had no jurisdiction to make an award, the Commission refused to make an interim award sought by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">On 25 October 1993, a Full Bench of the Commission published a decision following a review of wage fixing principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Among the principles it laid down for the making of first federal awards was a principle providing that: 


 
 'In awards regulating the employment of workers previously covered by a State award or determination, existing State award rates and conditions prima facie will be the proper award rates and conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">' 
 
 
 40 Following negotiations about the making of a federal award for the contract cleaning industry, the applicant entered into a memorandum of agreement dated 16 March 1994 ('the memorandum of agreement'), with the Australian Building Services Association, the Property Services Council of Australia, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and Eski Cleaning Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">That memorandum of agreement provided relevantly as follows: 


 
 'The parties agree: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">To make a joint application for a Federal Award that preserves rates 
 of pay and allowances as they were prescribed for the contract 
 cleaning industry in the expired awards of the former Industrial 
 Relations Commission of Victoria, known as the Building Services 
 Award, the Building Services (State Government Departments &amp; 
 Instrumentalities) Award, the Miscellaneous Workers Post-Secondary 
 Education (TAFE) Award and the Cleaners and Domestic Arts 
 Assistants (Government Schools) Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">That the Award made prescribe common conditions of employment 
 for the industry, other than where to prescribe such common 
 conditions of employment would result in a reduction in income 
 contrary to Point 1 of this agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">
 
 It is acknowledged by the parties that the implementation of 1 and 2 
 of this agreement shall be staged as follows: 
 
 (a) An initial application to the Commission for a minimum rates 
 award, the scope and Incidence of that award being in similar 
 terms to the Incidence of the former Building Services Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">

 (b) A second stage where the paid rates applicable in the former 
 paid rates awards applicable to the cleaning industry are 
 incorporated as separate parts into the Building Services 
 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">' 
 
 
 41 On 16 March 1994, a representative of the applicant announced the memorandum of agreement to Deputy President Acton of the Commission, and sought the making of an award in accordance with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In the course of his submissions, the applicant's representative told Deputy President Acton: 


 
 'The award that I would be asking that the commission make, arising out of today's proceedings is a minimum rates award, the incidence of which is in similar terms to the incidence of the former Building Services Award of the former Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">There will be a second stage in the implementation of this agreement at which time the parties will approach the commission and seek to have the award which we would have made today, amended to incorporate rates of pay which were expressed in the former state awards known as the Building Services State Government Departments and Instrumentalities award, the Miscellaneous Workers Post-secondary Education TAFE Award, and the Cleaners and Domestic Arts Assistance Government Schools Award, and that will be the subject of subsequent application to the commission, and of course there will need to be detailed negotiations between the parties as to the final form of such variations to the award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">' 
 
 
 42 The applicant's representative also told Deputy President Acton that the proposed award reflected the situation as it was when the Building Services Conciliation and Arbitration Board and the Building Services State Government Departments and Instrumentalities Conciliation and Arbitration Board had been restructured by decision of the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria on 7 March 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The abolition of those boards by statute in August 1992 led to the introduction into the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award of the incidence clause to which I have referred in [36].</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The Commission made the consent award, which is the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">


 
 43 As had been promised to Deputy President Acton, a further application was made to the Commission to incorporate into the 1994 Award the specific rates derived from several former Victorian awards, including the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The Commission heard that application on 20 July 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The application was not opposed by representatives of employers, although two of them expressed concern about differential rates within the industry and foreshadowed discussions with a view to absorbing the specific rates into future general increases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Commissioner Bacon accepted the submission of the parties and invited them to submit an order for him to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">This was the origin of cl 8A of the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">


 
 44 This history might be of some assistance to the respondent's case if there were any evidence that the non-payment of rates specified in the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award to those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre had ever been the result of a conscious decision not to apply those rates, or an awareness that, for some reason, they were inapplicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">For present purposes, I am prepared to accept that the construction of an award can be affected by a common understanding of the parties to it about a particular state of affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">If such a common understanding existed when the award was made, it should not be departed from when the Court comes to construe the award at a subsequent time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Care must be taken, however, to distinguish a common understanding from common inadvertence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">If the only reason why the government instrumentality rates were not paid at the Victorian Arts Centre was that neither the union nor the employer adverted to the possibility that there was an obligation to pay them, no common understanding results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In order to have an understanding, it is necessary that there be a meeting of minds, a consensus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">There can be no meeting of minds, no consensus, if no-one has thought about the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">


 
 45 Such evidence as there is in the present case leads to the conclusion that it is only in recent years that the applicant has realised that there is a possibility that those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre have been underpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">There were several parties to the memorandum of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">There is no evidence that any of those parties held a view on the issue at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">In this respect, three significant witnesses gave evidence in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Dimitrios Demos was the Operations Manager of the company that became the contractor for the cleaning of the Victorian Arts Centre from the time the Trust took possession of it in 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">He worked for that company until 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">During that time, he became its State Manager for Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">John Lazzari was the State Manager for Victoria of a predecessor company of the respondent from 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">He had direct responsibility for overseeing the carrying out of the contract to clean the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">At the time of the transition from State to federal regulation of terms and conditions of employment in the contract cleaning industry, Mr Lazzari was State President of the Building Services Contractors Association of Australia, which he said was incorrectly described in the memorandum of agreement to which I have referred in [40] as the Property Services Council of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In that capacity, he was a signatory of the memorandum of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">John Grant was on the State Executive of the Building Services Contractors Association of Australia at the time of the transition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">None of these three witnesses gave any evidence suggestive of a common understanding between the applicant or its predecessor and any employer, or employer association involved in the contract cleaning industry, to the effect that the Victorian Arts Centre was not regarded as premises of a State Government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">It is clear that no-one adverted to the status of the Trust, and to whether it was a State Government instrumentality for the purposes of either the earlier State award or the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">


 
 46 It is not the case that the applicant has changed its mind and gone back on a common understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">It is the case that no common understanding ever existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">
 Other construction arguments 
 

 
 47 The adoption of a purposive construction of the 1994 Award does not assist the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Even if the purpose can be ascertained from the express statements of the subjective intentions of the parties to the process of making the 1994 Award, acceptance that the purpose was to reproduce the situation as it had been in Victoria does not answer the question whether there existed an obligation to pay the government instrumentality rates to those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The stated purpose of the memorandum of agreement was to preserve rates of pay 'as they were prescribed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">If it could be shown that some provision of the earlier Victorian award excluded those employed to clean the premises of the Trust, the stated purpose of the memorandum of agreement would not be fulfilled if the 1994 Award, which was the result of the agreement expressed in the memorandum of agreement, were to be construed as including the Trust's premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">No such provision existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">On no view can an examination of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award, by itself or in the context of other provisions of the 1994 Award, yield a purpose as specific as the exclusion of the Trust from the concept of a State Government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The purpose was to provide higher rates of pay for those employed in cleaning in the premises of 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The question remains whether that concept includes or excludes the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">


 
 48 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' had become a term of art in relation to industrial instruments operating in Victoria by the time the 1994 Award was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">To establish this proposition, he tendered a copy of the original print of the Metal Industry (Victorian Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Interim Award 1981 ('the Metal Industry Award'), dated 14 October 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Clause 2 of the Metal Industry Award provided: 


 '2 --- PARTIES BOUND 
 
 This award shall be binding upon members of The Amalgamated Metal Workers' and Shipwrights Union, Australasian Society of Engineers, the Electrical Trades Union of Australia, The Federated Ironworkers' Association of Australia and the Victorian Government Departments and Instrumentalities named hereunder in respect of their employees performing work covered by this award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">

<sentence id="s193">
 Her Majesty the Queen In Right of the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">
 Housing Commission, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">
 Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">

 Geelong Harbour Trust Commissioners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">
 Port of Melbourne Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">
 Portland Harbour Trust Commissioners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">' 
 
 
 49 Just how the making of the Metal Industry Award could operate to create a term of art for industrial instruments is unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The organisations that later amalgamated to form the applicant were not parties to the Metal Industry Award, and therefore played no part in the choice of bodies named.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Mr Lazzari, who was a signatory to the memorandum of agreement referred to in [40], gave evidence that he was not aware of the list in the Metal Industry Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">It is unlikely that the concept of a State Government department or instrumentality could be frozen in time by a specific listing in one award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In any event, the list included 'Her Majesty the Queen In Right of the State of Victoria', an entity apt to include all statutory bodies entitled to the immunity of the Crown in right of the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">On the basis that the Trust is such a body, it would be comprehended by the list in the Metal Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">


 
 50 Although three witnesses with long experience of the contract cleaning industry gave evidence on behalf of the respondent, no witness gave evidence to the effect that the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' had become a term of art in the industry, whether as a result of the Metal Industry Award or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">


 
 51 Counsel for the respondent attempted to rely on the capitalisation of the initial letter of the word 'Instrumentalities' in each of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, as well as in the earlier Victorian award, as indicative that a particular meaning of the word had been intended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Capitalisation of the initial letters of words in headings is a common practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Inappropriate capitalisation of the initial letters of words, when not used in headings, is also common.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">It is unlikely to indicate the use of a term of art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">In any event, if a conscious decision had been made to use the word 'Instrumentalities' as a term of art, the option of defining it in the award was available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">It is unlikely that whoever drafted the 1994 Award made a conscious decision to use a term of art, and to indicate that a term of art had been used solely by the use of an initial capital letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">I do not accept that the fact that the word 'Instrumentality' has a capital initial in the 1994 Award and the earlier Victorian award that replaced it can be said to be indicative of a term of art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">This is so, even when the word is contrasted with the word 'instrumentality' in the clause considered by the High Court in the Anti-Cancer Council case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">


 
 52 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that I should have regard to possible anomalies that might arise from the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award to high-rise buildings, occupied by a mix of tenants, only some of which were State Government entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">This argument is completely irrelevant to the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">There is no suggestion that the Victorian Arts Centre is occupied by any entity other than the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The question of multiple occupancy of buildings and the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award is dealt with in Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union v Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 408 , a judgment delivered subsequent to the hearing of the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">


 
 53 For these reasons, I am persuaded that the word 'Instrumentalities' when used in the composite phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award is used in its ordinary and natural meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">When so used, as I have already found, it encompasses the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">
 Conclusion and orders 
 

 
 54 It follows that the respondent has been in breach of its obligations, imposed by cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, to pay the allowances required by those clauses to its employees engaged in performing cleaning services at the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">


 
 55 Section 178(2) of the WR Act provides that multiple breaches of a term of an award, arising out of a course of conduct, are to be treated as a single breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Counsel for the applicant accepted that all breaches of the 1994 Award were to be treated as a single breach and all breaches of the 2003 Award were to be treated as another single breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">This involves the concession that each of the relevant clauses contains a single 'term', for the purposes of s 178 of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">I am prepared to accept this concession in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">


 
 56 The maximum penalty applicable is $10 000 for each breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">There has been an increase in the maximum amount, by amendment to the WR Act since the proceeding was commenced, but counsel for the applicant conceded that the earlier maximum is the appropriate one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">In fixing the appropriate penalty, I bear in mind that the real penalty for the respondent will be the necessity to make the payments of underpaid entitlements, together with interest, to each of the employees underpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">This will be an expensive exercise for the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">It will have an effect on the profitability of the contract under which the respondent is responsible for the cleaning of the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">I accept that that contract was negotiated without regard to the need to pay the allowances specified by the 1994 Award and the 2003 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Some reference was made to the possibility of renegotiating the contract in light of the outcome of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Whether that can be done, and the Trust can be induced to pay a greater sum in respect of work already done, I do not know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">I also accept that, at least until recent times, the breaches have arisen from inadvertence, and not from a deliberate intention to underpay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">No suggestion was made that the respondent had a record of prior breaches of awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The only aggravating factor appears to be the want of any contrition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">In his evidence, Mr Lazzari was very dismissive of the claim, describing it as 'frivolous'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Obviously, there was a need for the respondent to look more closely at its obligations, when the issue was first raised by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">


 
 57 It is also necessary to acknowledge the need for deterrence in an industry in which Mr Grant, who has held several offices in the Building Services Contractors Association over a long period, acknowledged that there is some non-compliance with awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">


 
 58 Taking all these factors into account, it is appropriate to fix the penalty at $2000 in respect of the breach of the term of the 1994 Award and $1500 in respect of the breach of the term of the 2003 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The usual order is that a penalty be paid to the party seeking its imposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">There was no submission that such an order would be inappropriate in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Pursuant to s 356 of the WR Act, there will be an order that each penalty be paid to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">


 
 59 I also propose to make an order that the respondent pay to each of the persons it employed at the Victorian Arts Centre the amount agreed to be outstanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">To each amount there should be added interest, pursuant to s 179A of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">In this respect, the applicant's claim is modest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Because of the difficulty of calculation of interest when it is payable on a series of payments that were due over a long period, the applicant has asked for interest only from 1 June 2003, ie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">on the total sum owed to each employee in respect of the two periods claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">The applicant calculated that interest only up to the date when the case was being heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">It should be calculated to the date of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">As to the rate, the applicant sought interest at 11 per cent per annum, that being the operative rate at 1 June 2003, pursuant to the Penalty Interest Rate Act 1983 (Vic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">It is appropriate to choose that rate for the reasons advanced in EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">2) (1998) 160 ALR 382 at 384, and Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1406 at [91] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The rate of interest was increased to 11.25 per cent from 26 June 2003, and to 12 per cent from 1 July 2004, but counsel for the applicant forwent any entitlement to a rate greater than 11 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The order that I make for payment to each employee will therefore include an amount of interest on the sum owing to that employee at 1 June 2003, at the rate of 11 per cent per annum (non-compounding), from 1 June 2003 to the date of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">


 
 60 The case is covered by s 347 of the WR Act, so no question of cost arises.</sentence>

1 The circumstances revealed in this application for preliminary discovery suggest there is a need for the Minister administering the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth) ("the AFP Act ") and the Commissioner of Police to address the procedures and protocols followed by members of the Australian Federal Police ("AFP") when providing information to the police forces of another country in circumstances which predictably could result in the charging of a person with an offence that would expose that person to the risk of the death penalty in that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Especially is this so where the person concerned is an Australian citizen and the information is provided in the course of a request being made by the AFP for assistance from that other country's police force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">This said, the application to this Court must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">It reveals no basis for a reasonable cause to believe that the applicants may have a right to obtain relief in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Any later proceedings brought on the bases foreshadowed in this application would be purely speculative in character or else would have no prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 The four applicants, Scott Rush, Renae Lawrence, Michael Czugaj and Martin Stevens, are members of a group of Australian citizens known as the "Bali nine".</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">All were arrested in Bali for alleged involvement in heroin trafficking to Australia, the arrests resulting from action taken by the Indonesian police in consequence of precise details provided to that police by members of the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Each of the applicants is now exposed to death penalty if convicted of the offences with which they respectively have been charged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It is the action of AFP members in providing that information to the Indonesian police and its foreseeable consequence that has prompted the bringing of this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">THE APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY DISCOVERY 
 
3 Order 15A rr 3 and 6 of the Federal Court Rules provide respectively for what is colloquially known as "identity discovery" and "information discovery": see generally Hooper v Kirella [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">I am empowered by our Rules to order identity discovery where (i) an applicant, having made reasonable inquiries, is unable to ascertain the description of a person sufficiently for the purpose of commencing a proceeding in this Court against that person; and (ii) it appears that some other person has, has had, or is likely to have knowledge of facts or possession of any document tending to assist in ascertaining who that person is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 Information discovery in contrast is discovery against the very person against whom relief may be sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It is tightly circumscribed in the requirements to be met before discovery may be ordered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">These are that:
 
 
 "(a) there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained; 
 
 (b) after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief; and 
 
 (c) there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">" 
 
 

5 Common to both species of discovery is a prospective proceeding which may be commenced in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Inherent in this possibility are the requirements that the proceeding will be (a) within federal jurisdiction and (b) in respect of a cause of action known to law which is not purely speculative in character and which is not devoid of prospects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">There is no difficulty in this matter in relation to the former of these requirements, some at least of the prospective causes of action being said to arise under Commonwealth legislation: see Judiciary Act 1903 , s 39B(1A)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It is the latter requirement, which requires the identification of a possible cause of action (in this case a legal wrong done to the applicants), that is problematic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">6 It is unnecessary for me to refer in detail to the growing body of case law on preliminary discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to the following.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The O 15A r 3 power to order identity discovery is not to be used in favour of a person who intends to commence merely speculative proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">A material factor in the exercise of the Court's discretion is the prospect of the applicant succeeding in proceedings against the person wished to be sued: Hooper v Kirella at [33].</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Information discovery under O 15A r 6 is significantly limited by the conditions imposed in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of that rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Subpar (a) requires that there be reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">While the threshold test under this subrule may be set at quite a low level: see Gull Petroleum (WA) Ltd v Tah Land Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1531 at [59] ; the test for determining whether the applicant has a reasonable cause to have the requisite belief is an objective one: see Hooper v Kirella at [39].</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Though it is not necessary to demonstrate a prima facie case, it is not enough merely to assert that there is, or is the mere possibility of, a case against the prospective respondent: Hooper v Kirella at [39].</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Importantly, as Hely J observed in St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 at [26]:
 
 "(d) belief requires more than mere assertion and more than suspicion or conjecture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting a proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Thus it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter or fact in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists, that would dispose of the application insofar as it is based on that cause of action: John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 679 ; BC200403021 at [13], [14], [17] and [73].</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">" 
 

7 While O 15 r 6 expressly contemplates "fishing", it equally requires that each of the limiting conditions prescribed in subpars (a), (b) and (c) must be established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Preliminary discovery cannot itself be used to remedy deficiencies in the satisfaction of the conditions themselves: Airservices Australia Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 886 ; (1999) 92 FCR 200 at [5] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">8 Before outlining the factual setting of this matter I should indicate that it has undergone a significant transformation since the hearing of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I gave the applicants leave to file supplementary submissions directed primarily to the prospective causes of action they might wish to pursue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">They have acted upon this leave and, in quite some degree, have recast their cases for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">This explains why matters which received some attention at the hearing are only dealt with cursorily in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">FACTUAL SETTING 
 
9 Much in the detail of what follows relates only to the first applicant, Scott Rush, and gives rise to potential claims unique to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">As will become apparent, the cases of the other three applicants arise from their involvement in events in which Scott Rush as well was implicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The evidence in this matter was given by way of affidavit and without cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">In relation to Rush's case I should also indicate that a number of affidavits have been read which expose significant conflicts of evidence between witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">I should indicate that I have not been asked in the circumstances to make findings in relation to contested issues of fact in the material before me, the respondent being prepared to accept that their resolution is for another day, if at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">10 The annexures to several of the affidavits contain documents derived from the Dossier (or book of documents) relied upon by the prosecutor as evidence in the prosecution of the second applicant, Renae Lawrence, in the criminal proceedings in the Denpasar District Court in respect of an offence under Art 82(1) of the Law of the Republic of Indonesia No 22 of 1997 concerning Narcotics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The Dossier contained documents obtained by Indonesian Police as part of their investigation and has been made a public document by order of the Indonesian Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Reference will be made below to translations of a number of these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">11 The four applicants are Australian citizens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">On 6 April 2005, Renae Lawrence and Martin Stephens travelled to Bali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Scott Rush and Michael Czugaj travelled to the same destination on 8 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">12 Prior to Rush's departure from Australia, his father, Lee Rush, became aware he may have been travelling to Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Lee Rush was concerned that Scott might have been travelling to Bali to be involved in illegal activity and, according to his evidence, he was determined to help save him from committing any offence in Bali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">13 Lee Rush contacted a barrister and family friend, Robert Myers, to seek advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Myers had acted for Scott Rush on a number of minor criminal prosecutions concerned, in the main, with dishonesty offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Myers in turn contacted a friend of his, Damon Patching, a member of the Queensland Police Service who was at the relevant time seconded to the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Before referring to the evidence of Mr Myers and Mr Patching, I foreshadow that there are important differences between each's account of their several conversations particularly in relation to what Mr Patching is alleged to have said would be done, and had subsequently been done, by the AFP at Sydney Airport in relation to Scott Rush.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">14 Myers' evidence is that he requested that Rush be detained at Sydney airport and prevented from leaving Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">He referred to Rush's prior convictions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It was the case that Rush was on bail at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Myers went on that if the AFP could not detain Rush he should be stopped at his point of exit and be advised that the AFP were aware he was "up to no good", that he would be watched in Bali and that it would be foolish for him to participate in illegal activity there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">15 Patching, according to Myers, said the AFP would talk to Rush if a passport alert ("a PACE alert") was activated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">He was later told by Patching that this had occurred and that Rush had been spoken to at the airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Myers then spoke to Lee Rush and told him that, given what the AFP had done, he and Lee Rush had done all they could conceivably do and there was no necessity for Lee Rush to go to Bali to stop Scott.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">16 Lee Rush's evidence of his conversations with Myers corroborated Myers' accounts and it was because of those conversations that he desisted from going immediately to Bali to stop his son committing any offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">17 Mr Patching's evidence was that in one of his conversations with Myers he indicated he would contact Ashley Durre, another Queensland Police Service Officer on secondment with the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It was agreed with Durre that Patching should arrange for a PACE alert to be placed on Scott Rush.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Patching contacted Federal Agent Osseily who handled PACE alert matters at Sydney Airport, who activated the alert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Osseily, Patching said, informed him he did not think "it was a goer" for the AFP to approach Scott and to warn him he was of interest to the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Patching said he knew at the time it would be unusual for police to make such an approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">When he later rang Robert Myers and was asked whether Scott Rush would be approached and spoken to by the police, Patching deposed he said that "may be looked at as a possibility ... depending on the circumstances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">He denied he gave any assurance that Rush would be approached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The next day Patching received a call from Federal Agent Collins at Sydney Airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Collins asked him whether Rush's bail conditions would prevent him leaving the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">After enquiries in Queensland, Patching informed Collins they would not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">He also told Collins that Lee Rush wanted Scott to be approached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Collins commented this was not usual practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Patching denied he gave Myers an assurance or undertaking at any stage that Scott Rush would be approached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">18 Mr Durre's affidavit corroborated Patching's evidence in his recall of conversations with Patching to the extent he was present at and overheard telephone conversations Patching had with others including Myers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">19 Mr Osseily's evidence described the PACE alert system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">It is maintained by the Australian Customs Service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">It is used by particular Federal and State agencies both as a means of gathering intelligence on persons entering or leaving Australia and also as a means of preventing certain targeted individuals from entering or leaving the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">20 Mr Osseily said he created the PACE alert on Scott Rush on the basis of information that his bail conditions prevented him from departing Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">He derived this information from Patching.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">21 Mr Collins, who was on duty at the AFP office at Sydney Airport on 8 April, gave evidence that he was informed that morning of the alert on Scott Rush and that the basis of it was that Rush's bail conditions stipulated he was not allowed to depart Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">He spoke to Patching and was told of Lee Rush's concern about Scott's visit to Bali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Collins then contacted the relevant Queensland State Police and ascertained that there were no bail conditions preventing him leaving the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">This evidence is not consistent with Patching's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">By that time the passengers would have commenced boarding the flight to Bali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">As he said in his own words:
 
 
 "16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">My conclusion at this stage was that there was no reason for Scott Rush to be detained and that he should be allowed to leave without being disturbed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">My view was that despite the concerns of Lee Rush, Scott Rush was an adult and there was no basis for detaining Scott Rush.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">I recall running my decision past my supervisor after outlining the results of my investigations and that my supervisor agreed with my decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">
 
 17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">I then contacted the Customs and advised the officer on duty that the AFP would be taking no further action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">" 
 
 

22 On 8 April 2005, Paul Hunniford, who was the AFP Senior Liaison Officer in Bali, sent a letter (translated into Indonesian) to the Indonesian National Police ("the INP") in Denpasar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It said (omitting formal and irrelevant detail)"
 
 "Subject: 
 
 Heroin couriers from Bali to Australia --- Currently in Bali 
 
 Dengan hormat, 
 
 The AFP in Australia have received information that a group of persons are allegedly importing a narcotic substance (believed to be Heroin) from Bali to Australia using 8 individual people carrying body packs strapped to their legs and back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">More specifically the information received that: 
 
 The group planned to conduct an importation in December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The group travelled to Bali in December 2004 but the importation was cancelled because there was not enough money to buy 'the stuff' and that they would be travelling again in 3-6 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The group returned to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">
 
 The couriers were given instructions not to smoke cigarettes for two weeks prior to travel as they would not be allowed to smoke on the return flight as they may appear nervous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">They were to carry body packs (containing white powder) back to Australia by using packs on both legs and the back supports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">They were also supplied back supports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The packs were to be tightly taped to the person's body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Members of the group were given expense money and told to change the money into local currency to allow them to buy oversized clothes and thongs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The clothes and thongs were not to have any metal on them to avoid the metal detectors at the airports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The couriers received pre-paid mobile telephones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">On return through Customs they were told to be carried [sic] a wooden carving for declaration to Quarantine to by-pass Customs.</sentence>

24 James Watson, an AFP member and legal adviser to the Commissioner and to AFP members, has given the following evidence in relation to these two letters:
 
 "5.4 contrary to what has been widely reported in the media, the information concerning Scott Rush which is reflected in the abovementioned letters dated 8 and 12 April 2005 was not based upon information received from Mr Meyers [sic] or Mr Lee Rush via Senior Constable Patching.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Quite apart from the PACE alert placed by Senior Constable Patching, prior to Scott Rush's departure overseas on 7 April 2005 he (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Scott Rush) activated another PACE alert, which was handled by the AFP's case officer (Federal Agent Hingst) who had carriage of the AFP's extant investigation into members of the so-called 'Bali 9'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">It was the triggering of this alert which connected Mr Rush with eight other already identified persons of interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">It was information obtained in the course of this extant AFP investigation (including as a result of the activation of the PACE alert handled by Federal Agent Hingst) which caused Mr Rush's details to be included in the AFP letters of 8 and 12 April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">" 
 

25 Mr Watson also has stated that in sending the two letters to the INP the AFP were acting pursuant to what I will describe as the Police Cooperation Memorandum of Understanding with Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">26 Between 9 pm 17 April 2005 and 2 am 18 April 2005, the four applicants were among the nine Australians who were detained by the INP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">They were found in possession of what was alleged to be significant quantities of heroin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">A process of investigation had previously been initiated by the INP on 13 April in consequence of the 8 April letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">27 On 17 April 2005 the INP issued a formal "Investigation Order".</sentence>

The Order was effective from 17 April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">28 On 18 August 2005, the INP wrote to the Australian Consul in Bali formally informing the consulate that Renae Lawrence had been arrested and detained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The arrest warrant of 17 April and the Detention Order of 18 April were enclosed.</sentence>

<sentence id="s172">31 After referring below to statutory and other materials relevant to this case which do or are said to govern the conduct of the AFP in this matter, I will refer to what are agreed facts as to Australian Federal Police practice in relation to police to police cooperation particularly in matters which could expose a person to the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">RELEVANT STATUTES, TREATIES, INSTRUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Statutes 
 (i) The Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 (Cth) 
 
32 This Act provides the backdrop to the causes of action that might be relied upon in any prospective proceeding to be brought by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">This Act abolished capital punishment in respect of offences under the laws of the Commonwealth and the Territories and, within the limits of Commonwealth legislative power, under Imperial Acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">(ii) The Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth) 
 
33 The significance of this Act to the applicants' case only became apparent in their supplementary written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">For present purposes I would emphasise the following features of this legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">First, it constituted the Australian Federal Police: s 6; and defined its functions and powers: ss 8 and 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Amongst its functions are the provision of police services in relation to laws of the Commonwealth and the safeguarding of Commonwealth interests: s 8(1)(b)(i) and (iii); and to do anything incidental or conducive to the performance of these functions: s 8(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The Act created the position of Commissioner of Police: s 6 and s 17; it conferred on the Commissioner, subject to the Act, the general administration of, and the control of the operations of, the AFP: s 37(1); it empowered the Commissioner to issue orders, in writing, in the exercise of his or her s 37 powers and AFP employees were obliged to comply with such orders, as they were with any lawful direction given by (inter alia) the Commissioner: ss 38, 39 and 40.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">34 The Minister administering this Act was likewise empowered to give written directions to the Commissioner with respect to the general policy to be pursued in relation to the performance of the functions of the AFP: s 37(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The Commissioner was obliged to comply with such directions: s 37(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">On 31 August 2004 such a direction was given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">It indicated that one of the expectations the Government had of the AFP was:
 
 "to be active in pursuing opportunities for cooperation and strategic alliances with ... international partners in law enforcement, to support effective action against multi-jurisdictional crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">" 
 

The AFP was to give "special emphasis" to (inter alia):
 
 
 " preventing, countering and investigating transnational and multi-jurisdictional crime, illicit drug trafficking ... 
 
 meeting Commonwealth interests in a safe and secure Australia by actively fostering relationships with other law enforcement agencies ... within Australia and overseas, where the provision and exchange of information is consistent with AFP functions ..." 
 
 

35 The AFP Act and the Australian Federal Police Regulations made under it apply both throughout and also "outside Australia": the AFP Act , s 5A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Finally, in abolishing the "independent discretion" rule exemplified in Enever v The King [1906] HCA 3 ; (1906) 3 CLR 969, s 64B provided (insofar as presently relevant) that: 
 
 
 "(1) The Commonwealth is liable in respect of a tort committed by a member in the performance or purported performance of his or her duties as such a member in like manner as a person is liable in respect of a tort committed by his or her employee in the course of his or her employment, and shall, in respect of such a tort, be treated for all purposes as a joint tortfeasor with the member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">" 
 
 
 
 (iii) The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (Cth) ("the Mutual Assistance Act") and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Republic of Indonesia) Regulations 1999 ("the Regulations") 

36 This Act assumed its presently relevant form as a result of amendments made to it in 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The 1996 legislation aimed (to quote the "Outline" to the Explanatory Memorandum to the 1996 Bill) to:
 
 
 " clarify the areas in which mutual assistance in criminal matters may only be sought by the Attorney-General and the areas in which assistance may be sought using other channels 
 
 enable the Attorney-General to grant or request assistance without the Act having to be applied by regulation to a particular country 
 
 give the Attorney-General a discretion to refuse assistance where the request relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person for an offence in respect of which the death penalty could be imposed or carried out 
 
 enable the Attorney-General to refuse assistance where he considers it appropriate in the circumstances of a particular request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">" 
 
 

37 The areas in which a request was required to be made by the Attorney-General, or to the Attorney-General in respect of a request by a foreign country, for international assistance in a criminal matter, were specified in the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Put shortly, they related to matters that would require either Australia (in respect of a foreign request) or the foreign country (in respect of an Australian request) to exercise coercive powers: see ss 5, 7, 10 and 11 and Parts II to VIIA of the Act; see also Second Reading Speech, Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, House of Representatives, Wed 26 June 1996, 2831-2832.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">38 Though the applicants initially placed considerable reliance upon the Mutual Assistance Act at the hearing, it is clear that (a) no request for assistance was made by the Governments of either Australia or Indonesia under this Act in this matter and (b) the assistance sought and given was not "of a kind that may be provided or obtained under this Act": s 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The applicants in consequence cannot rely directly on the Act in their search for a possible cause of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">39 It is also clear that the Mutual Assistance Act was not intended to prevent the provision or obtaining of international assistance in criminal matters other than assistance of a kind specified in the Act: s 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Nonetheless, the Act within its scope does address the giving of assistance at a foreign country's request in death penalty contexts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">40 The 1996 amending Act referred to above inserted the following paragraphs into s 8 of the principal Act:
 
 
 "(1A) A request by a foreign country for assistance under this Act must be refused if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with, or convicted of, an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed in the foreign country, unless the Attorney-General is of the opinion, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, that the assistance requested should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">
 
 (1B) A request by a foreign country for assistance under this Act may be refused if the Attorney-General: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) believes that the provision of the assistance may result in the death penalty being imposed on a person; and 
 
 (b) after taking into consideration the interests of international criminal co-operation, is of the opinion that in the circumstances of the case the request should not be granted :" emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">
 
 

41 In consequence of the provisions of s 7 and of the Regulations, the Act applied subject to the limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications as were necessary to give effect to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Treaty with Indonesia ("the Mutual Assistance Treaty"): the Mutual Assistance Act, s 7(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">42 The Regulations applied the Act to Indonesia "subject to the Mutual Assistance Treaty": reg 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">That Treaty was done at Jakarta on 27 October 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">A copy of the English text was a schedule to the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">43 Article 2 of the Treaty echoed the terms of s 6 of the Act in providing:
 
 "This Treaty shall not derogate from obligations subsisting between the Contracting Parties whether pursuant to other treaties or arrangements or otherwise nor prevent the Contracting Parties providing assistance to each other pursuant to other treaties or arrangements or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">" 
 

44 To anticipate matters, the actions taken by AFP officers in this matter in providing information to the Indonesian Police was pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and Indonesia entitled "Memorandum of Understanding Between the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the Government of Australia on Combating Transnational Crime and Developing Police Cooperation ("Police Cooperation MoU").</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">The Commissioner has indicated that this MoU would not be produced on this application first, because it is information of the type the application is designed to elicit if an order for information discovery was made and secondly, because its disclosure would be resisted on grounds of public interest privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">45 The Mutual Assistance Treaty also contemplated (in Art 4.2(d)) that assistance might be refused if the request related to "the prosecution or punishment of a person for an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed or carried out".</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">46 Amongst the criminal matters in which the Treaty contemplated assistance could be granted was "an offence against the law relating to dangerous drugs or narcotics".</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Treaties and Agreements 
 
47 Reference has been made above to Australia's Mutual Assistance Treaty with Indonesia and to its undisclosed MoU with Indonesia which, apparently, provided the basis for the actions of the AFP officers in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">48 The applicants also rely in this application upon Australia's ratification both of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 13 November 1980 ("the ICCPR") and, more importantly for present purposes, of the Second Optional Protocol to that Covenant on 2 October 1990 ("the Protocol"), it coming into force on 11 July 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Under the Protocol, Australia agreed that no one within its jurisdiction would be executed: Art 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Under the Covenant, Australia agreed (inter alia) that "Every human being has the inherent right to life": Art 6.1; see also Art 3, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Guidelines 
 
49 Under reg 4 of the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations 1979 an AFP member is obliged to have regard to any official guidelines that apply to the performance of his or her duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">In their original submissions and at the hearing considerable reliance was placed by the applicants on the "AFP Practical Guide on International Police to Police Assistance in Death Penalty Charge Situations" ("the Death Penalty Charge Guide").</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">It is now acknowledged in the applicants' supplementary submissions that this Guide is not directly relevant in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">50 Nonetheless, the terms of the Death Penalty Charge Guide warrant quotation:
 
 "The Attorney-General in consultation with the Minister for Justice has determined that in future Australia will exercise a discretion when considering foreign requests for mutual assistance in criminal matters where the request relates to a charge attracting the death penalty under the law of the requesting country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">In the exercise of that discretion, assistance may be refused in the absence of an assurance from the requesting country that the death penalty would not be imposed or carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The Attorney-General has decided that this policy will also apply to police to police requests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">
 
 Consistent with the Attorney-General's decision, in future the following will apply in relation to AFP cooperation with overseas law enforcement agencies: 
 
 
 
 &#8226; police to police cooperation may continue on the present basis i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">the AFP may provide such assistance as requested, provided it meets existing policy guidelines, irrespective of whether the investigation may later result in charges being laid which may attract the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">
 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; where the assistance of the AFP is sought by the police or another law enforcement agency of a foreign country in relation to a matter in which a charge has been laid under the law of that foreign country, for a crime attracting the death penalty, no action is to be taken, nor should any indication be given as to the decision likely to be taken in respect of the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">All such requests are to be notified to the Director International and Operations as soon as possible after receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Following consultation with the Attorney-General's Department, the General Manager National Operations will provide the Commissioner and Deputy with such advice as considered necessary in order that advice may be provided to the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General:" emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Indonesian Laws 
 
51 Articles 82(1)(a) and 78(1)(b) of the Indonesia Narcotics Statute as I have called it, provide respectively that:
 
 "Art 82(1) Whosoever without a right and illegally: 
 
 
 (a) imports, exports, offers for sale, traffics, sells, purchases, offers up, accepts, or acts as an intermediary in the sale, purchase or exchange of a Category 1 narcotic is to be punished by the death sentence or life imprisonment, of not more than 20 (twenty) years imprisonment and a fine of not more than Rp 1,000,000,000.00 (one billion rupiah); 
 
 Art 78(1) Whosoever without a right and illegally: 
 
 ... 
 
 b. possesses, stores for their own possession or for supply, or is in control of a Category 1 narcotic not in plant form, is to be sentenced to not more than 10 (ten) years jail and fined a maximum of Rp 500,000,000.00 (five hundred million rupiah).</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">" 
 

52 I understand it to be the case that each of the applicants have been charged under both of these provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Australian Federal Police Practice 
 
53 The following are agreed facts as to AFP practice: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The Death Penalty Charge Guide replicates government policy in relation to how the AFP goes about investigating offences that may attract the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">It clearly sets out what information the AFP will pass over to foreign law enforcement agencies, the stages it will do so and what the AFP will not pass to foreign law enforcement agencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The Guide does not apply where the assistance requested is in relation to a person who has not been charged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Once the person has been charged then under the Guide, the AFP requires the authorisation of the Attorney-General and/or the Minister for Justice and Customs to be able to hand over that information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Any police assistance given prior to the laying of the charge ceases after the person has been charged and does not continue unless the necessary authorisation is given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">In relation to the Bali 9 case, the Guide did not apply to the assistance provided because no charges had been laid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The Guide does refer to arrangements for police-to-police cooperation where the suspect has not been charged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">In such cases the AFP would continue to supply information as required, provided it meets existing policy guidelines, irrespective of whether the investigation may later result in charges being laid which may attract the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Police to police information may be provided pursuant to an MoU with the requesting country or an existing treaty between Australia and the requesting country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">In the absence of an MoU or a treaty the AFP may still provide assistance at its discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The AFP relies generally on the provisions of the AFP Act as a basis for providing the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The Guide applies in relation to common law countries as well as civil law countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">In relation to civil law countries where a charge is usually laid only after a dossier is prepared, evidence is gathered and a case is made, the AFP will cooperate up to the point a charge is laid irrespective of whether the dossier is being prepared for a likely charge which will eventuate in the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Any information handed over to foreign law enforcement agencies is recorded on the AFP internal systems and there is a very strict audit trail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Not all requests for assistance prior to a suspect being charged can be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">For example, where assistance requires coercive powers to be exercised here in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Such requests would need to fall under the Mutual Assistance Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The Guide is the only internal policy guideline which applies in relation to international police-to-police assistance in death penalty charge situations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">The Attorney-General and Minister for Justice and Customs are not aware or notified as a matter of course, of the documents that the AFP provides to a foreign law enforcement agency prior to a charge being made involving the death penalty unless the Attorney-General requests a briefing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The decision to provide assistance is an operational decision for the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Briefings of the Minister are not normally done prior to the AFP making an operational decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">
 THE APPLICANTS' CASES 
 
54 The identity discovery sought by all of the applicants, is that of the member or members of the AFP who made the operational decisions to request assistance from the INP regarding the applicants and who provided assistance to the INP concerning the applicants' activities in Bali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">That additionally sought by Scott Rush is the identity of the member or members of the AFP who made the operational decisions (a) not to inform him prior to his departure from Australia that he was under surveillance and being monitored by the AFP and (b) not to advise his parents or Mr Myers of the decision not so to inform him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">55 In their written submission, the applicants point to communications with an officer of the Australian Government Solicitor ("the AGS") in which inquiries as to the identity of the relevant persons were made but note that as a result of those inquiries and of the affidavits filed by the respondent, they are still unable to identify the members of the AFP, other than Mr Hunniford, who have been involved in making decisions or taking actions that have exposed the applicants to the risk of the death penalty in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">56 The information discovery sought is of documents of the AFP which relate to operational and other decisions which led to the arrest and detention of the applicants on 17/18 April 2005 in Bali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The written submissions indicate non-exhaustive categories of such documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">They refer also to the same correspondence with the AGS noted above and claim that the information so acquired from the Commissioner is insufficient to enable the applicants to make a decision whether to commence a proceeding in the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">In particular the submissions point to the insufficiency of the information in relation to ascertaining whether there is a valid legal basis for the apparent decision or course of action which exposed the applicants to the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">57 I have already indicated that the manner in which the applicants cast their possible causes of action has changed significantly subsequent to the hearing, as is evident from their supplementary written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Notwithstanding these changes to which I will refer below, their possible causes of action fall under three rubrics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">The first two can be described as involving applications for declaratory and possibly other relief against AFP officers (yet to be identified), they having (i) acted without lawful authority in making decisions and taking actions which exposed the applicants to the death penalty in Indonesia; or (ii) failed to satisfy the applicants' substantive legitimate expectations as Australian citizens that the Australian Government and its agencies and public officers would not act in such a way as to expose them to the risk of the imposition of the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The third rubric is that of tort law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">First, it is asserted that Lee Rush's provision of information to the AFP concerning the possible activities of his son gave rise to a relationship creating a duty on members of the AFP not to use that information in a way that would expose at least Scott Rush to the foreseeable risk of the death penalty in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Further, in the circumstances surrounding the provision of the information to the AFP, the AFP assumed responsibility for Scott Rush.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">The possible tort claim in this is said to be in negligence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Distinctly, it is asserted that there is potentially a claim for misfeasance in public office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">58 I will consider each of these three possibilities in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">CONSIDERATION 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Acting without lawful authority 
 
59 As it was initially put, the applicants' case as I understand it would be to the effect that the requests made to the INP for assistance in the two Hunniford letters of 8 and 12 April 2005 ought to have been made, if at all, under the Mutual Assistance Act in which case they would have to have been made by the Attorney-General.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The requests in consequence were made unlawfully.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">60 To the extent that this contention was premised on the proposition that the requests made were for assistance of a kind that could be obtained under the Mutual Assistance Act it is demonstrably untenable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">The Hunniford requests were not for the exercise in Indonesia of any of the coercive powers specified in that Act and for that reason they could not be requests for assistance under the Act: cf s 10(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">I need not repeat here what I have earlier said in relation to the limited scope of the Mutual Assistance Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">61 To avoid this conclusion the applicants now seek to construe the Act in such a way that any request for international assistance in a criminal matter, whether or not of a kind that may be made under the Act, must be made by the Attorney-General.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Section 10(2) is relied upon to that end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">This is not what the sub-section says.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Section 10(1) prescribes that the Attorney-General alone must make any request for assistance of a kind that Australia is authorised to make under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Subsection (2) of the same section, though, makes plain that subsection (1) does not prevent the Attorney-General on behalf of Australia from requesting assistance beyond what can be obtained under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">What the subsection does not say is that the Attorney-General is to be the exclusive channel for such other requests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">It is permissive not prescriptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">62 Other provisions both of the Mutual Assistance Act and of the Mutual Assistance Treaty with Indonesia make plain that no such limitation on the making of other requests was so intended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Section 6 of the Act expressly states that the Act does not prevent the provision etc of international assistance in criminal matters other than assistance of a kind that may be provided under that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Section 5 (the objects provision) states the purpose of the Act to be (inter alia) to facilitate the obtaining by Australia of international assistance in criminal matters: s 5(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">The interpretation of s 10(2) proposed by the applicants impedes rather than advances that purpose especially in light of s 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Distinctly, the Mutual Assistance Treaty (the provisions of which limit the applicability of the Mutual Assistance Act to requests between Australia and Indonesia: see s 7(3)(a)) expressly provides that the Treaty does not derogate from obligations subsisting between the contracting parties, nor does it prevent them from providing assistance to each other: Art 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Finally, if Parliament had intended through s 10(2) to impose such a fetter on obtaining international assistance in criminal matters as the applicants submit, thereby precluding the taking of such action as would otherwise be mandated by other legislation (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">the AFP Act : see below), one would have expected it to have spoken with far greater clarity than it has, the moreso given the purpose of the Act noted above: see Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (1996) 137 ALR 47 at 63-64.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">63 I am in consequence satisfied that, on the proper construction of the Mutual Assistance Act, any foreshadowed cause of action founded on that Act must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">In the circumstances it provides the applicants with no basis for any reasonable cause to believe they may have a right to obtain relief in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">64 In supplementary submissions, the focus of the applicants' prospective ultra vires case turned to the provisions of the AFP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">The relevant provisions of this Act and of directions given under it are set out at [33] to [35] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">It is now contended that the functions and powers set out in ss 8 and 9 of that Act, when read in context, do not include, authorise or justify any act or decision made by an AFP member which exposes an Australian citizen to the death penalty, whether in Australia or overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">The context referred to in this submission is said to be provided by the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 ("the Abolition Act "), the provisions of s 8(1A) and (1B) of the Mutual Assistance Act, unambiguous Australian Government policy which is opposed to the death penalty (at least for its citizens) and Australia's signing of the Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">65 What this proposed claim would ask for would be a significant reading down of what on its face is the unambiguous meaning of s 8 of the AFP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">As the 8 and 12 April letters make plain, the provision of information by members of the AFP to the INP related to a suspected importation of heroin contrary to the "laws of the Commonwealth".</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">In consequence it fell squarely within the lawful functions of the AFP: s 8(1)(b) and s 8(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">It was, moreover, an activity within the scope of what was envisaged in the ministerial direction made under s 37(2) of the AFP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">It involved cooperation with the INP "to support effective action against multi-jurisdictional crime"; it related to "illicit drug trafficking"; and it reflected the active fostering of a relationship with the INP involving "the provision and exchange of information ... consistent with AFP functions": Ministerial direction of 31 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Nonetheless, it is said that context requires this reading down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">66 It is now well accepted that the modern approach to statutory interpretation requires that "context" be considered at the first instance, not merely at some later stage when ambiguity might be thought to arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">"Context" here is used in a wide sense and includes legal and historical context: see CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2 ; (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408; Braverus Maritime Inc v Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd [2005] FCAFC 256 at [36] ; see also Allsop, "Statutes: Context, Meaning and Preenactment History", Jo of NSW Bar Assoc, Winter 2005, 19 ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">It is questionable whether any of the matters relied upon are relevantly contextual for the purposes of interpreting s 8 of the AFP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">67 The international treaties and instrument that have been ratified by Australia and on which the applicants rely have not as such been incorporated into Australian law by express enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">The Abolition Act pre-dated Australia's signing up to the Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Neither the Abolition Act nor the Protocol addresses action taken by Australian public officers or agencies vis-&agrave;-vis foreign law enforcement agencies in connection with offences in their jurisdiction which can there attract the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Neither expressly or impliedly prohibits taking such action as, for example, the provision of information of the type contained in the Hunniford letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Neither expressly betrays an intent in relation to such action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">The Abolition Act cannot thus properly be used to read down s 8 of the AFP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">The Second Optional Protocol only came into effect for Australian purposes years after the enactment of s 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">It provides no contextual aid to the section's interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">In any event it imposes no obligation on a Contracting Party vis-&agrave;-vis a non-contracting party in respect of the former's dealings with the latter in relation to offences in the latter jurisdiction which can attract the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Even if s 8 was relevantly ambiguous, the Second Optional Protocol could not assist in resolving that ambiguity: see Dietrich v R [1992] HCA 57 ; (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 306; Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade v Magno (1992) 37 FCR 298 at 303-304.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">68 The Mutual Assistance Act (which again post-dates the AFP Act ) neither provides context for the construction of the AFP Act nor reveals any intent to amend s 8 so to effect a reading down of the AFP's functions as suggested by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">In the circumscribed discretions reserved to the Attorney-General to provide assistance in death penalty cases, ss 8(1A) and (1B) expressly acknowledge there is no absolute prohibition of the type propounded by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">69 Moreover, when one has regard to the Death Penalty Charge Guide (see [50] above) with which AFP officers must comply, it is contemplated that police to police cooperation, as here, is to occur on the basis that the AFP may provide the assistance requested irrespective of whether the investigation to which it relates may later result in charges being laid which may attract the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">70 It may be possible to discern in Australian legislation, treaties, official guides, etc a declared antipathy to the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">That antipathy, though, has not been pursued unqualifiedly in our legislation and guides in relation to dealings with foreign countries in respect of matters which could attract the imposition of the death penalty: cf the Mutual Assistance Act ss 8(1A) and (1B) and the Extradition Act 1998 (Cth) s 22(3)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">It is unsurprising that it has not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">In particular contexts, the call of other public interests may be the more powerful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">As was said in Rodriguez v United States 480 US 522 (1987) at 526: "Deciding what competing values will or will not be sacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative choice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">71 I do not consider that the applicants have made out any reasonable cause to believe they have an arguable case for the reading down of s 8 of the AFP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">I should add for the sake of completeness that it may be the case that, even if the AFP Act were to be read down as contended for, it would not prevent members of the AFP from making the request they did in the absence of legislative authority: cf Barton v The Commonwealth [1974] HCA 20 ; (1974) 131 CLR 477 at 490.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">It is unnecessary to express any view on this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">72 A distinct way in which the applicants had proposed challenging the propriety of the AFP members' conduct in making the two requests was to contend that that conduct did not comply with the requirements of the Death Penalty Charge Guide such that, arguably, those members committed disciplinary offences under reg 4 of the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations 1979.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">It was not made at all apparent how, even if such disciplinary offences could have been made out, this would have availed the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">73 As I understand the applicants' supplementary submissions they no longer rely upon breach of the Guide and Discipline Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">However, I should make the following comments in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">First, and subject to what I later say, the Guide, on its face, may well be only of indirect relevance in this matter in that its substantive content is directed to how AFP members are required to act in relation to requests for assistance made of it by a foreign country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">It is silent on requests made by the AFP of an overseas law enforcement agency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Secondly even if the standards prescribed in the Guide (with appropriate adaptation) be taken as the operative ones when a request is made by the AFP --- and I consider this was probably their intendment --- the conduct of the officers concerned in this case (whoever they may have been beyond Mr Hunniford) could not properly be said to have been relevantly in breach of the Guide as it related to "police to police" cooperation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">The requests made and the information provided pre-dated the INP investigations and the arrests and detention of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">In consequence it pre-dated any "charges being laid which may attract the death penalty" irrespective of how the term "charges" should be interpreted in the Guide as it applied to the formalities of the Indonesian legal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Finally there was, as I have indicated, authority for the AFP members to make their request under the AFP Act and that in turn was translated into a practical arrangement with Indonesia in the Police Cooperation MoU under which, according to Mr Watson, the actual requests were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">The MoU is not in evidence before me for the reasons I earlier gave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Nonetheless, counsel for the applicant was provided with the opportunity to inspect the MoU or to have the Court inspect it, but declined to take either course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Counsel for the Commissioner has nonetheless indicated to the Court that the terms of the MoU contemplated the very provision of information by the AFP in circumstances such as in this matter and it could properly be said of the MoU that there was a standing request by Indonesia for such assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">In the above circumstances, I am prepared to accept (a) that the applicants cannot claim reasonably to believe that the information provided to Indonesia was totally unsolicited and (b) that, possibly, the AFP in providing the information was acting upon a general request by Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">However, for the reasons I gave above, I do not consider it to be of any consequence whether the request was made by the AFP or by Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">The AFP members acted in conformity with the Death Penalty Charge Guide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">74 Despite their various and varying formulations of a potential cause of action based on what compendiously I have called acting without lawful authority, I am not satisfied that the applicants have been able to identify or articulate any reasonable cause to believe that they are or may be entitled to obtain relief in this Court under this rubric.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">Not satisfying the applicants' substantive legitimate expectations 
 
75 The potential cause of action advanced here is not one it is open to me to entertain as Australian authority now stands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">The invitation held out to me is to embrace the law on "substantive legitimate expectation" as adumbrated in decisions of the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong in Ng Siu Tung v Director of Immigration (2002) 5 HKCFA 1 and of the House of Lords in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department; ex parte Zeqiri [2002] UKHL 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">The impediments to my so doing are substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">As Sir Anthony Mason recently observed: "It would require a revolution in Australian judicial thinking to bring about an adoption of the English approach to substantive protection of legitimate expectations": (2005) 12 Aust Jo of Admin Law 103 at 108.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">76 The applicants initially sought to contend that they had in Australian law an enforceable right to life and not to be executed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">The ICCPR and the Second Optional Protocol were invoked to this end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">This was later abandoned, as it had to be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">The provisions of an international treaty do not form part of Australian law merely because Australia is a ratifying party to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">For that reason neither the ICCPR nor the Second Optional Protocol of itself "operate[s] to give rights to or impose duties on members of the Australian community: Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 85 ; (1999) 84 FCR 438 at [35] ; see also Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57 ; (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 305-306.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">77 Scott Rush sought as well to allege a denial of procedural fairness in that he was not advised prior to his departure from Australia that he was under surveillance and being monitored, after assurances were allegedly given by a member or members of the AFP to Scott Rush's parents (via Mr Myers) that he would be so advised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">78 The alleged expectation of procedural fairness that was said to have so arisen resulted from (on the evidence in Scott Rush's case) communications made directly or indirectly to his father and not to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">It was not suggested that Scott Rush had any awareness of those communications or that he ordered his conduct in consequence of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">This prospective cause of action had no prospects of success at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">79 Even if (a) an obligation of procedural fairness could arise in the setting of present concern (see below) and (b) the alleged duty to be advised could properly be described as being procedural and not substantive in character: see Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 22; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 ("Teoh") at 291; the particular expectation in question, arising as it allegedly did, was not one entertained by Scott Rush: see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam ; [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 ("Lam") at [36], [90]-[93], [95] and [145].</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">In consequence, Scott Rush would have been unable to show practical injustice done to himself: Lam , at [36].</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">As I understand it, from the applicants' supplementary written submissions, no reliance is now being placed by Scott Rush on a possible claim so framed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">80 It is now the applicants' position that each of them, in their capacity as Australian citizens, has a substantive legitimate expectation that the Australian Government, its agencies and public officers will not act in such a way as to expose them to the risk of the imposition of the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">The supplementary written submissions, though, do not go on to indicate how, in this matter, this expectation provides a reasonable cause to believe that the applicants may have a right to relief in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">81 For present purposes all I need note of the "doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation" is what was said of it in the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong in Ng Siu Tung v Director of Immigration at [92]:
 
 "The doctrine recognizes that, in the absence of any overriding reason of law or policy excluding its operation, situations may arise in which persons may have a legitimate expectation of a substantive outcome or benefit, in which event failing to honour the expectation may, in particular circumstances, result in such unfairness to individuals as to amount to an abuse of power justifying intervention by the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Generally speaking, a legitimate expectation arises as a result of a promise, representation, practice or policy made, adopted or announced by or on behalf of government or a public authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">" 
 

This in turn drew upon the reasons of Lord Woolf MR (for the court) in R v North and East Devon Health Authority; Ex parte Coughlan [2001] QB 213; see also Craig, Administrative Law, 639-656 (5 th ed 2003); Sedley, "The last 10 years' development of English public law", (2004) 12 Aust Jo of Admin Law 9 at 18-20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">82 In light of the decisions of the High Court in Teoh and in Lam it is clear that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is for the present not part of Australian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">For present purposes I need only refer to the joint judgment of McHugh and Gummow JJ in Lam at [66]-[67]:
 
 "The doctrine of 'legitimate expectation' has been developed in England so as to extend to an expectation that the benefit in question will be provided or, if already conferred, will not be withdrawn or that a threatened disadvantage or disability will not be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">This gives the doctrine a substantive, as distinct from procedural, operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">
 
 
 
 
 
 The earlier English decisions with respect to 'legitimate expectations' were discussed by Mason CJ in Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin and by McHugh J in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh .</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">In Quin , Mason CJ observed: 
 
 
 
 'In the cases in this Court in which a legitimate expectation has been held entitled to protection, protection has taken the form of procedural protection, by insisting that the decision-maker apply the rules of natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">In none of the cases was the individual held to be entitled to substantive protection in the form of an order requiring the decision-maker to exercise his or her discretion in a particular way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">The prevailing view in this Court has been, as Stephen J observed in Salemi [v MacKellar [No 2] ], that: '[t]he rules of natural justice are "in a broad sense a procedural matter"", echoing the words of Dixon CJ and Webb J in Commissioner of Police v Tanos .</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 That remains the position in this Court and nothing in this judgment should be taken as encouragement to disturb it by adoption of recent developments in English law with respect to substantive benefits or outcomes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">" 
 
 

83 For the purposes of O 15A rr 3 and 6 the applicants are thus unable to show that a claim for relief based on the "doctrine" so relied upon could lead to relief being granted in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Tort 
 
84 Two potential tort claims have been suggested in support of the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">In Scott Rush's case a possible claim in negligence is foreshadowed; and in the cases of all of the applicants, claims for misfeasance in public office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">(i) Negligence 
 
85 Scott Rush's potential negligence claim has been propounded in the following way in the supplementary written submissions: 
 
 
 "17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">On the facts in this case, the relevant question to be asked is this: did the provision of information by Mr Lee Rush concerning the possible activities of his son (the First Applicant) to a member or members of the AFP, give rise to a relationship creating a duty on members of the AFP not to use that information in a way that would expose the First Applicant and/or others to the (foreseeable) risk of the death penalty in Indonesia?</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">
 
 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">[T] his case is concerned with the reasonable expectation on the part of Mr Lee Rush and, by implication, the First Applicant, that information provided by Mr Rush would not be used by the AFP in a way that would expose the First Applicant to the risk of the death penalty, and with positive acts done by a member or members of the AFP which did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">
 
 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">It is submitted that, in the circumstances surrounding the provision of information to the AFP concerning the possible activities of the First Applicant, the AFP impliedly undertook not to use, or act upon, the information in such a manner as to put the First Applicant at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia, and so, at least to that extent, assumed responsibility for the First Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">" 
 
 

86 What is immediately apparent in the above is that it attempts neither to locate the alleged duty to Scott Rush in the context of an ongoing AFP investigation nor to justify the imposition of the duty in such a context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Rather, it addresses the question whether the circumstances of Lee Rush's providing information to the AFP founded a reasonable expectation in Lee Rush that the AFP would not use, and an implied undertaking (though to whom is not stated) not to use, that information in a particular way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">While that inquiry may be a step in the fashioning of an action for breach of confidence by Lee Rush, or a possible duty of care to Lee Rush (if, hypothetically, the unauthorised disclosure of the information would expose Mr Rush to a reasonably foreseeable risk: cf Swinney v Chief Constable of Northumbria Police [1997] QB 464), it does not lead necessarily or obviously to potential relief for Scott Rush in a negligence action by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">At best it hints at Lee Rush's having put the AFP in a position of power over Scott Rush, a position which carried with it an obligation not to exercise that power adversely to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">What I should emphasise as well is that whatever claims, if any, Lee Rush might be able to mount against an officer or officers of the AFP in consequence of their dealings --- and I do not suggest that the present circumstances suggest he might have any such claims --- he is not a party to this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">87 I referred above to the absence of reference to the context in which the duty allegedly owed Scott Rush is said to arise for this reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">In Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35 ; (2002) 211 CLR 317 ("Tame") at [231] Gummow and Kirby JJ observed in dicta:
 
 "It is unlikely that an investigating police officer owes a duty of care to a person whose conduct is under investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Such a duty would appear to be inconsistent with the police officer's duty, ultimately based in the statutory framework and anterior common law by which the relevant police service is established and maintained, fully to investigate the conduct in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">" 
 

Their Honours cited in support of this view the decisions (inter alia) of Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police [1987] UKHL 12 ; [1989] AC 53 ("Hill") at 63-65 and Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59 ; (2001) 207 CLR 562 at [60] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Similar views were expressed in Tame by McHugh J at [125]-[126]; Hayne J at [298] and by Callinan J at [335]-[336].</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">88 Understandably, the respondent's submissions focus (a) on the impossibility of there being such an obligation in this matter given its incompatibility with the actual investigation being conducted by the AFP at the time; (b) on the alleged false premise of the supposed obligation given that the AFP had, on Mr Watson's evidence, derived the relevant information connecting Scott Rush with the eight other members of the group from an extant AFP investigation; and (c) on Scott Rush being the author of his own harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">89 Before I express my own views on this, I should emphasise the following.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Bearing in mind that this is an application for preliminary discovery where information about the possible commission of a tort is being sought, exceptional caution must be exercised before reaching a conclusion that, whatever the information that might be disclosed as a result of an order for information discovery, that information could make no difference for the reason that the duty contended for could not even arguably be imposed on AFP members when conducting the drug trafficking investigation in question: cf the observations of Lord Bingham in Brooks v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2005] UKHL 24 ; [2005] 1 WLR 1495 at [4] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">90 As noted earlier, there are conflicting versions as to the substance of the conversations between Robert Myers (on behalf of Lee Rush) and Mr Patching of the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">The alleged duty of care is premised upon acceptance of Myers' version of what transpired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">For present purposes, and dealing with the matter on the basis most favourable to the applicants, I am prepared to assume the correctness of that version for the purposes of this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Nonetheless, I am satisfied from what is already known about the circumstances surrounding Myers' communications with Patching, that the negligence claim as it has been framed would in any event be unarguable irrespective of any further information relevant to it that might conceivably be forthcoming if an order for information discovery were to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Accordingly, I am satisfied for the purposes of O 15A r 3 that no such proceeding for negligence could properly be brought in this Court and, for the purposes of O 15A r 6, there is no reasonable cause to believe that Scott Rush may have a right to obtain relief on the basis proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">91 It is widely accepted in common law jurisdictions that, at common law, police officers owe to the general public a duty to enforce the criminal law and, correspondingly, that latitude necessarily must be given to those responsible for the conduct of police operations in the judgments required to be made to that end: see generally Hinchcliffe v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2001] FCA 1747 ; (2001) 118 FCR 308 at [33] - [35] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">As Lord Denning observed in R v Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall; Ex parte Central Electricity Generating Board [1982] 1 QB 458 at 472: "It is of the first importance that the police should decide on their own responsibility what action should be taken in any particular situation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">92 It equally is well recognised that to impose common law duties of care on police officers to a particular member or members of the public in addition to their duty to the general public can, on occasion, be "inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of [their public] responsibilities": cf Sullivan v Moody , at [62]; (whether those responsibilities arise under a statute such as the AFP Act or at common law) and to be impermissible for that reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">As the observations of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Tame illustrate, this inconsistency is often revealed where, in a setting in which injury is foreseeable if care is not taken in the conduct of a police investigation, a suspect, a victim, or a third party injured by acts or omissions of the police seeks to raise a claim in negligence against the police: Hill , above; Thompson v Vincent [2005] NSWCA 219 at [152] - [154] ; Batchelor v State of Tasmania [2005] TASSC 11 ; Cran v State of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 92 ; (2004) 62 NSWLR 95; see also D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 214 ALR 92 at [101] ; State of New South Wales v Paige [2002] NSWCA 235 ; (2002) 60 NSWLR 371 at [115] - [117] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">Save in exceptional circumstances: cf Hill at 62; Batchelor , above; and in North America see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Doe v Board of Commissioners for Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (1990) 72 DLR 4 th 580 ("Doe"); Eaton, "Liability of Municipality or Other Governmental Unit for Failure to Provide Police Protection from Crime" 90 ALR 5 th 273 at SS4 ; 57 Am Jur 2d, "Municipal, County, School and State Tort Liability", SSSS407-418; such attempts have been unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">93 Primary concerns manifest in English and, in some degree, Australian case law have been to maintain the effectiveness of particular police functions (and notably the conduct of investigations and the suppression of crime) and to avert their compromise or undermining by the imposition of a duty to an individual (or individuals) over and above that owed to the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">In English law this has led to the adoption of an exclusionary principle (or immunity) which is often cast in broad terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">So, for example, in Calveley v Chief Constable of Merseyside Police [1989] 1 AC 1228 it was said by Lord Bridge (at 1238) that:
 
 "... it would plainly be contrary to public policy ... to prejudice the fearless and efficient discharge by police officers of their vitally important public duty of investigating crime by requiring them to act under the shadow of a potential action for damages for negligence by the suspect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">" 
 

94 The progenitor of this principle was the decision of the House of Lords in Hill .</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">After concluding that, in the circumstances of that case, the ordinary principles of negligence would not admit of a duty of care to a victim of crime, Lord Keith went on to indicate (at 63) that there was "another reason" why an action for damages in negligence should not be against the police in the circumstances of that case and that was "public policy".</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">His Lordship then observed:
 
 "The general sense of public duty which motivates police forces is unlikely to be appreciably reinforced by the imposition of such liability so far as concerns their function in the investigation and suppression of crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">From time to time they make mistakes in the exercise of that function, but it is not to be doubted that they apply their best endeavours to the performance of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">In some instances the imposition of liability may lead to the exercise of a function being carried on in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">The possibility of this happening in relation to the investigative operations of the police cannot be excluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Further it would be reasonable to expect that if potential liability were to be imposed it would be not uncommon for actions to be raised against police forces on the ground that they had failed to catch some criminal as soon as they might have done, with the result that he went on to commit further crimes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">While some such actions might involve allegations of a simple and straightforward type of failure --- for example that a police officer negligently tripped and fell while pursuing a burglar --- others would be likely to enter deeply into the general nature of a police investigation, as indeed the present action would seek to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">The manner of conduct of such an investigation must necessarily involve a variety of decisions to be made on matters of policy and discretion, for example as to which particular line of inquiry is most advantageously to be pursued and what is the most advantageous way to deploy the available resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">Many such decisions would not be regarded by the courts as appropriate to be called in question, yet elaborate investigation of the facts might be necessary to ascertain whether or not this was so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">A great deal of police time, trouble and expense might be expected to have to be put into the preparation of the defence to the action and the attendance of witnesses at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">The result would be a significant diversion of police manpower and attention from their most important function, that of the suppression of crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Closed investigations would require to be reopened and retraversed, not with the object of bringing any criminal to justice but to ascertain whether or not they had been competently conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">I therefore consider that Glidewell LJ, in his judgment in the Court of Appeal [1988] QB 60, 76 in the present case, was right to take the view that the police were immune from an action of this kind on grounds similar to those which in Rondel v Worsley [1967] UKHL 5 ; [1969] 1 AC 191 were held to render a barrister immune from actions for negligence in his conduct of proceedings in court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">" 
 

 95 Hill's case, I would note, has been referred to approvingly in some number of High Court judgments: see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Sullivan v Moody at [57]; Tame at [231], [335]; see also Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]; Cran v State of New South Wales , at [33] ff; but cf contra Zalewski v Turcarolo [1995] 2 VR 562 a decision which pre-dated Sullivan v Moody .</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">96 I will return below to whether such an exclusionary principle based on public policy accurately reflects the law in this country; see Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]; or whether the "principle" does no more than represent the usual or predictable, but not invariable, consequence of the evaluation of whether the relationship between the police and an individual in a given instance imports a duty of care in the context of a police investigation: cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan [2002] HCA 54 ; (2002) 211 CLR 540 at [149] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Before so doing, it is important to emphasise that police officers are not as such and in all circumstances immune from the law of negligence for acts or omissions in the course of official duty that occasion foreseeable harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">The contrary is clearly the case, as a large case law in common law jurisdictions, including England, attests: Zalewski v Turcarolo ; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police [1999] 1 All ER 550; see also Grubb (ed), The Law of Tort , "The Police" 16.73 ff (2002); Linden, Canadian Tort Law , 286, 625 (7 th ed 2001); Todd (ed), The Law of Torts in New Zealand , 204, 212 ff (3 rd ed, 2001); Eaton, above 90 ALR 5 th 273.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">97 By way of illustration I would note that a duty of care has been assumed, or found to exist:
 
 (i) in the conduct of a high speed police motor vehicle pursuit of a suspected criminal ( Schilling v Lenton (1988) 47 SASR 88; see also Marshall v Osmond [1983] 1 QB 1034; 57 Am Jur 2d, above SS439); 
 (ii) where a superior officer failed to go to the assistance of another officer whom he knew was being attacked close by and for whom he had a responsibility ( Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police , above; Mullaney v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police [2001] EWCA Civ 700) ; 
 (iii) in positively provoking or acting in disregard of a real and substantial risk of harm to a person ( Zalewski v Turcarolo , above) or property ( Rigby v Chief Constable of Northamptonshire [1985] 1 WLR 1242); 
 (iv) in providing for the safety and well-being of persons in police custody ( Hall v Whatmore [1961] VR 225; Howard v Jarvis [1958] HCA 19 ; (1958) 98 CLR 177; Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1999] UKHL 35 ; [2000] 1 AC 360); 
 (v) in relation to preserving the confidentiality of information provided by an informant identifying a criminal suspect, the disclosure of which was likely to expose the informant and her husband to a greater risk of harm at the hands of the suspect than the ordinary risk to the general public ( Swinney v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police );
 (vi) in Canada, to protect a woman who was unaware she was knowingly being used by police as "bait" to catch a serial rapist in circumstances in which the police deliberately failed to warn of the risk she faced for fear of compromising their investigation though knowing that the rapist would attack again and cause irreparable harm to his victim ( Doe v Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) Commissioners of Police (1998) 160 DLR 4 th 697); and
 (vii) in a United States jurisdiction, in delaying in responding to calls made by assault victims, the assurance that help was on its way having been given to them ( Chambers-Castanes v King County 669 P2d 451 (1983); and see Zitter, "Liability for Failure of Police Response to Emergency Call" , 39 ALR 4 th 691).</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">

98 What is noticeable in the case law of common law countries illustrated above (including that of England) is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that, particularly in cases of omissions to act, the police may nonetheless have, or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a "special relationship" with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her: see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">Brooks v Commissioner of Police at [22] and [29]; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police esp per May LJ; in US jurisdictions the "special relationship" exception is well recognised in a range of otherwise negligence exempt areas of police activity, see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">Eaton, above at SS4 ; see also 57 Am Jur 2d, above, at SS410 ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">What equally is notable is the varying significance given to the particular "operational" context in which the relationship giving rise to a duty of care is said to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Hence the ready imposition of a duty of care to persons in police custody: Hall v Whatmore , above; and the corresponding reluctance to impose such a duty in the context of the conduct of a criminal investigation D'Orta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at [101]-[102]; see also Cran v State of New South Wales , above; or in preventing a breach of the peace: Thompson v Vincent , above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">99 Australian case law, while generally conforming in its results with particularly comparable English decisions, has not unreservedly committed itself to the public policy immunity prevailing in England.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">The Court of Appeal of New South Wales on a number of occasions --- and most recently in Cran v State of New South Wales --- has adopted an approach to cases involving investigative conduct that reflects the immunity principle found in English decisions and particularly Hill's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">In Cran v State of New South Wales it was noted by Santow JA that in Tame's case, "there are strong dicta suggesting that the English authorities would be followed in Australia" (at [35]) and that "on present authority [in New South Wales] the greater public interest accorded unimpeded investigation by the police ... preclude[d] any duty of care to the appellant" (at [63]) in that case where a prisoner claimed damages for post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from unnecessarily prolonged imprisonment because of delay in a police investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">100 In contrast, the 1995 decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria and the recent Tasmanian decision of Batchelor v State of Tasmania are more questioning of whether the immunity principle (at least in the scope given it) is part of Australian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">101 It is, in my view, unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether, as in England, a special though not unqualified, immunity rule applies to police activities "in the investigation and suppression of crime": Costello's case at 563; or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and, if relevant, common law functions: see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan .</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">However, I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating "reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire ... has been thought to lay down" on the immunity of police: cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police , at [3], [6] and [28]; and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity: see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">Costello ; Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary [2001] EWCA Civ 1699 ; tell in favour of avoiding any special rule applicable to police, while still acknowledging that the police function can have distinctive characteristics and purposes which in many settings may exclude the concurrent operation of a duty of care at common law: cf Doe , 72 DLR 4 th at 584-586.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">102 Sullivan v Moody did not involve an allegation of negligence against police officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">Its concern was with whether medical practitioners and social workers who had examined children for evidence of sexual abuse by their fathers in the setting of a statutory regime containing provisions for the protection of children (including mandatory reporting to a government department of reasonable suspicion of child abuse), owed a duty of care to protect such fathers in the conduct of their examinations, investigations and reporting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">It was held unanimously by the High Court that they did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">The plaintiff fathers had alleged that, as a result of negligent examination, diagnosis and reporting, they had suffered shock, distress, psychiatric injury and consequential personal and financial loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">Unsurprisingly, given the opinions expressed by the Court, Sullivan v Moody has been influential in this country in later decisions and judicial commentary on police liability for negligence in the conduct of investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">103 In rejecting the duty of care argued for in Sullivan v Moody the Court observed:
 
 
 "55.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">... A duty of the kind alleged should not be found if that duty would not be compatible with other duties which the respondents owed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">
 
 56.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">How may a duty of the kind for which the appellants contend rationally be related to the functions, powers and responsibilities of the various persons and authorities who are alleged to owe that duty?</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">A similar problem has arisen in other cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">The response to the problem in those cases, although not determinative, is instructive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">
 
 57.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">In Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire , the House of Lords held that police officers did not owe a duty to individual members of the public who might suffer injury through their careless failure to apprehend a dangerous criminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Lord Keith of Kinkel pointed out that the conduct of a police investigation involves a variety of decisions on matters of policy and discretion, including decisions as to priorities in the deployment of resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">To subject those decisions to a common law duty of care, and to the kind of judicial scrutiny involved in an action in tort, was inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">
 
 ... 
 
 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The circumstance that a defendant owes a duty of care to a third party, or is subject to statutory obligations which constrain the manner in which powers or discretions may be exercised, does not of itself rule out the possibility that a duty of care is owed to a plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">People may be subject to a number of duties, at least provided they are not irreconcilable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">A medical practitioner who examines, and reports upon the condition of, an individual, might owe a duty of care to more than one person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">But if a suggested duty of care would give rise to inconsistent obligations, that would ordinarily be a reason for denying that the duty exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Similarly, when public authorities, or their officers, are charged with the responsibility of conducting investigations, or exercising powers, in the public interest, or in the interests of a specified class of persons, the law would not ordinarily subject them to a duty to have regard to the interests of another class of persons where that would impose upon them conflicting claims or obligations .</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">
 
 ... 
 
 62.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">The statutory scheme that formed the background to the activities of the present respondents was, relevantly, a scheme for the protection of children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">It required the respondents to treat the interests of the children as paramount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Their professional or statutory responsibilities involved investigating and reporting upon, allegations that the children had suffered, and were under threat of, serious harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">It would be inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of those responsibilities that they should be subjected to a legal duty, breach of which would sound in damages, to take care to protect persons who were suspected of being the sources of that harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">The duty for which the appellants contend cannot be reconciled satisfactorily, either with the nature of the functions being exercised by the respondents, or with their statutory obligation to treat the interests of the children as paramount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">As to the former, the functions of examination, and reporting, require, for their effective discharge, an investigation into the facts without apprehension as to possible adverse consequences for people in the position of the appellants or legal liability to such persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">As to the latter, the interests of the children, and those suspected of causing their harm, are diverse, and irreconcilable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">That they are irreconcilable is evident when regard is had to the case in which examination of a child alleged to be a victim of abuse does not allow the examiner to form a definite opinion about whether the child has been abused, only a suspicion that it may have happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">The interests of the child, in such a case, would favour reporting that the suspicion of abuse has not been dispelled; the interests of a person suspected of the abuse would be to the opposite effect:" emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">
 

104 As I earlier noted, the judgment of Gummow and Kirby JJ in Tame relied on Sullivan at [60] above when expressing the view that it was unlikely that an investigating police officer would owe a duty of care to a person whose conduct was under investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame .</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">In its apparent endorsement of Hill at [57] in the above quotation, Sullivan along with Hill and D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid above, have been treated by the New South Wales Court of Appeal as recognising that there is "an area in which it has been held that the public law duties of police are not consonant with recognition of a private law duty of care in favour of a particular member of the public": Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154].</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Again, as I have already noted, Tame and its debt to Sullivan and Hill were relied upon again by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Cran v State of New South Wales in privileging the greater public interested accorded unimpeded police investigation over the interest of a person suffering foreseeable harm as a result of an allegedly careless omission in the conduct of an investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">105 In light of the above cases, and putting to one side the effect if any of the communications between Mr Myer and Mr Patching, there would be no arguable basis at all for any contention that AFP officers had a legal responsibility to warn any of the applicants either that they were under police surveillance or that they were exposing themselves to the foreseeable risk of the death penalty especially given the information acquired about the applicants in the ongoing AFP investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">Having been prepared for whatever reason to engage in criminal activity, the applicants would properly be regarded as the authors of their own harm: cf Emanuele v Hedley [1998] FCA 709 esp in its reliance on State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold (1991) 25 NSWLR 500 at 517.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">And the police would have been entitled to have treated them as no more than subjects of an ongoing criminal investigation which fell clearly within the mandated functions of the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Given the police's function in the matter, the applicants would not have been objects of rescue (as they would have been if there was a duty to warn).</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">106 Did the Myer-Patching communications, as I am assuming them to be, give such a different complexion to the relationship of AFP officers with Scott Rush and/or with the other applicants as to establish an arguable case that a duty such as is proposed by the applicants was owed to him or to them?</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">In my view they did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">107 First, it needs to be emphasised that the AFP was performing a statutorily mandated function, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">the provision of legal services in relation to laws of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">The particular subject of the inquiry --- transnational crime and illicit drug trafficking - fell within areas of "special emphasis" in the direction given to the Commissioner by the Minister on 31 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">As the 8 April 2004 letter to the INP reveals, the AFP was already possessed of a considerable body of information relating to past and likely prospective moves of (inter alia) the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">That letter indicated the AFP's purpose in making its request was that "[t]he AFP would like to identify the source of the drugs and the organisers (other than CHAN) in Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">In other words there was a rational and proper police purpose for the making of the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">If there was to be a concurrent common law duty of care, this was the statutory and operational setting with which it had to be compatible: cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan at [147].</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">108 Secondly, there was no contact between the AFP and any of the applicants at all let alone contact that could lead Scott Rush or any of the others to reasonably believe or expect that the AFP had assumed some tutelary responsibility for him or her on which each could rely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">109 The Myer-Patching communications were directed to Lee Rush, not to the applicants generally or to Scott Rush in particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">I assume for the purposes of this application, that those communications led Lee Rush reasonably to believe that AFP officers would and did speak to Scott Rush at Sydney airport and because of this he did not go to Bali to save his son from committing any offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">I equally assume that Scott Rush was to have been the beneficiary of the police action Lee Rush believed had occurred and that the police failure to speak to him before his departure to Bali denied him the opportunity to abandon his participation in the trafficking operation given its predictable consequence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">However, it is not the failure to warn as such that underpins the alleged negligence of the AFP officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">Rather it appears to be said that, having regard (a) to the alleged provision of information by or on behalf of Lee Rush to Patching about the apprehended criminal activity by Scott Rush, and (b) the request for assistance in relation to Scott Rush's departure from Sydney and the alleged representation that it had been given, the AFP's failure to act against this background may have authored a duty not to use the information in a way that put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Hence it is said there is reasonable cause to believe that he may have a right to obtain relief from the relevant AFP officers in a negligence action in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">110 It is unnecessary to enlarge here on the question whether this Court would have jurisdiction in any event to entertain such a suit in negligence in the Northern Territory against members of the AFP as Commonwealth officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">I simply adhere to the affirmative view I expressed on a similar question arising in the Australian Capital Territory in O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1180 ; (2000) 101 FCR 160.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">My reasoning in that case is "equally applicable to the Northern Territory": ALRC Report 92, The Judicial Power of the Commonwealth, 652 (2001).</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">111 The proposed negligence claim could well be described as a mutated form of breach of confidence action with the important difference that the duty said to be owed by the AFP officers was not owed to the supplier of the information, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">Lee Rush, but to the subject of it, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">Scott Rush.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Furthermore the limitation on the use of that information proposed by the applicants is a narrow one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">It is not that the AFP could not use the information supplied at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Rather it could not be used in a way that would put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">112 It need hardly be said that the disclosures of information about Scott Rush made by or on behalf of Lee Rush to AFP officers could not give rise to a duty of confidence to Lee Rush such as would prevent its use by the AFP in its investigations into drug trafficking into Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">The disclosures related to apprehended serious criminal misconduct: cf Corrs Pavey Whiting &amp; Byrne v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434 esp at 456.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">And a court would not enforce any contractual or equitable obligation relating to such information, the effect of which would have been to obstruct the administration of the criminal law: A v Hayden [1984] HCA 67 ; (1984) 156 CLR 532.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">113 Recasting the matter in terms of a duty of care owed to Scott Rush does not advance the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">While it is said that the AFP had assumed a responsibility for Scott Rush in the circumstances surrounding the Myer/Lee Rush provision of information to AFP officers, the basis for such an assumption of responsibility has not been explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">Neither has any possible justification been advanced for there being a concurrent duty of care to Scott Rush alongside the public law duties of the AFP officers concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">114 There is a short answer to the alleged duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">Even if it be the case that AFP officers said they would act, or had acted, in a particular way towards Scott Rush at the airport and failed to do so, neither their representations and their failure to act nor the circumstances of the Myer-Patching conversations could give rise to a duty such as is alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">The proposed duty would be inconsistent with the duty owed by the AFP to the public at large in the conduct of its investigations into the Bali drug trafficking operation: cf Sullivan v Moody at [60].</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">115 I have already indicated that the AFP officers concerned did not act in contravention of the AFP Act in deciding to, and in making, the 8 and 12 April 2005 communications to the INP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">They were acting in performance of their functions under the AFP Act and consonantly with ministerial directions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">The communications made had a proper and rational purpose in the furtherance of that police investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">The proposed duty would only qualify and impede the conduct of the investigation embarked upon by the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">It would elevate the interests of Scott Rush over the public interest that the AFP was serving under its legislation to the extent that the two collided, as it did in the making of the request to the INP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">116 If, as the other applicants seem to suggest albeit faintly, a like duty was owed them its obvious effect would have been to compromise the investigation itself in an important respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">No assistance of the type sought could have been asked of the INP notwithstanding that the investigation involved transnational criminal activity and that the assistance in fact sought, as I have noted, was for a proper purpose in furtherance of the AFP's statutory functions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">117 In the cases of Scott Rush and of the other applicants the duty contended for cannot be reconciled with the nature and purpose of the functions being exercised by the AFP officers concerned, the discretions conferred on them in virtue of the task they were involved in, and the policy directive they were, apparently, implementing: cf Sullivan v Moody at [62].</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">Accordingly, to adopt Santow JA's observations in Cran v State of New South Wales at [63], the greater public interest accorded unimpeded investigation by the AFP precludes in this case any duty of care owed to Scott Rush or to the other applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">Such is the current law in this country and the policy informing it, that the interests of the applicants were subordinated to the public interests served by the AFP in their conduct of the investigation in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">118 I should add for the sake of completeness that I do not consider that it would make any difference to this conclusion if it was the case that the AFP officers concerned had knowingly misled Lee Rush for the purposes of securing the Bali investigation from potential compromise (given its purpose as revealed in the 8 April 2001 request) and the stage reached in the AFP's own investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">Whatever the moral wrong to a caring parent that may have been involved in so doing, it could not have authored a duty of care such as has been proposed in this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">119 No order for either identity discovery or information discovery will be made in relation to the intended cause of action based on the alleged possible negligence of AFP officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">That proceeding would have no prosects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">(ii) Misfeasance in Public Office 
 
120 The applicants contend that the facts of this case as presently known to them raise, as a potential cause of action, the tort of misfeasance in public office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">For the purposes of the elements of the tort, it is said that:
 
 (i) the actions and decisions causing harm to the applicants were done by public officers (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">Mr Hunniford and others unknown); 
 (ii) the actions and decisions involved the purported exercise of powers as a public official; and
 (iii) the actions and decisions were done with reckless indifference to the possible lack of powers or invalidity and to the likely injury to the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">

121 It is unnecessary for present purposes to discuss the elements of this tort in any detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">They were recently essayed by the Full Court of this Court in Sanders v Snell (No 2) [2003] FCAFC 150 ; (2003) 130 FCR 149.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">I would note, though, that the tort can take two forms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">In one form (that of "targeted malice") it must be shown that the public officer in question has acted as such with an actual intent to cause injury to a person or persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">In its alternate form it must be shown either that the officer has actual knowledge both that his or her action was beyond power and would cause or be likely to cause injury or else that the officer has acted with reckless indifference both to the possibility his or her action was beyond power and to the possibility that that action would cause or be likely to cause injury: see generally Sanders v Snell (No 2) at [95]-[100].</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">122 The applicants' contentions in relation to this tort require that close attention be given to the requirements of O 15A r 6 in particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">I emphasise this for this reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">123 The essence of the misfeasance tort in either of its forms is the "dishonest abuse of power": L (a child) v Reading Borough Council [2001] EWCA Civ 346 ; [2001] 1 WLR 1575 at 1588.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">I am in complete agreement with the submissions of the respondent that there is no basis at all in the material before me to suggest any reasonable cause to believe that Mr Hunniford or other AFP officers acted with the reckless indifference asserted in the applicants' supplementary written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">What is being advanced is at best "a mere possibility".</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">The evidence does not "incline the mind" towards assenting to the proposition asserted: cf St George Bank Pty Ltd v Rabo at [26].</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">124 I have already indicated that the actions of the AFP officers concerned with the decisions and actions which led to the applicants' arrest were not of themselves ultra vires.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">There is no reasonable cause to believe that the decisions or actions were invalid because they were improperly motivated or that the officers were recklessly indifferent to the possible lack of power or validity in making those decisions or actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">Rather, on the evidence, they were referable to the Police Cooperation MoU with Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">And while it was a foreseeable and likely consequence of the 8 and 12 April letters to the INP, that the applicants would be arrested in Indonesia and in that sense be exposed to harm in the sense of being put at risk of the death penalty, there is again no material at all which could objectively incline me to the proposition that the likelihood of that harm was other than a possible consequence of what was in the circumstances a valid exercise of official power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">125 Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the applicants have met the limiting conditions of O 15A r 6(a) for the purposes of information discovery in respect of the potential tort of misfeasance in public office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">Equally I am not satisfied for the purposes of O 15A r 3 identity discovery that the prospective proceedings intended to be commenced would be other than speculative: Hooper v Kirella , at [33].</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">Hence this form of discovery will not be ordered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">CONCLUSION 
 
126 I will order that the application be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty-six (126) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn.</sentence>

<sentence id="s4">2 The claim is for an order for transfer of the telephone number of the business to the applicant and damages for failure to transfer the telephone number at settlement and for loss of goodwill from solicitation pre and post settlement and for failing to deliver financial records relating to the accounts of past and current customers of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The claim for interlocutory relief relates to the first principal claim, namely an order to occasion the telephone number of the business to be transferred to the applicant at no cost to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">This therefore is an application for interlocutory relief which, at least to the extent of the first claim in the application, would be decisive of it.</sentence>

<sentence id="s8">The child care business purchased by the applicant is conducted at 21 Norman Street, Karrinyup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The business at that address was formally known as Tommie Turtle Karrinyup Child Care Centre.</sentence>

<sentence id="s11">The Brochure represented that the child care business had a weekly turnover of $7250, was strong and profitable in trading and had the potential to expand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Around 21 April 2005 the applicant and another company of which the second and third respondents were the only directors --- Patson Enterprises Pty Ltd, then mistakenly thought to be the company which owned the child care business --- entered into a written contract for sale of the business as a going concern ('the Original Contract').</sentence>

 (i) the purchaser being satisfied as to the profitability of the business 
 (ii) an increase being made to the child care fees being charged to be comparable with other centres within a 5 kilometre radius; 
 (iii) the trading hours being shortened from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday to Friday than 6:30 am and 6:30 pm.</sentence>

 (c) that on settlement the First Respondent will deliver the financial records relating to the accounts of past and current customers of the business; 
 (d) that the First Respondent would conduct the business as a going concern until settlement and conduct it efficiently, in a proper and businesslike manner, to the best of its skill and ability, in order to maintain goodwill and the profitability of the business and not terminate the employment of existing employees; 
 (e) that the First Respondent would do all things necessary for effectively vesting the business in the purchaser; 
 (f) that on settlement the First Respondent deliver any documents providing evidence of ownership of telephone numbers associated with the business and do all things necessary for effectively vesting in the purchaser the business including assistance in the transfer of the telephone number; 
 (g) that the First Respondent would provide on settlement all records relating to enquiries or approaches made by prospective customers or clients and relating to concluded or pending negotiations for children for the centre so that the purchaser would receive on settlement the benefit of any pending enquiries; 
 (h) that the First Respondent would not for a period of 5 years after settlement engage in conduct derogating from the purchaser's right to obtain the full benefit of the goodwill of the business; 
 (i) the First Respondent would not from the date of the Original Agreement and for a period of 5 years after settlement disclose or use or attempt to use any confidential information regarding the business including confidential financial information and details of customers, past or current negotiations or transactions relating to customers or the business; 
 (j) that the First Respondent would not for a period of 5 years after settlement solicit, canvass or endeavour to obtain the custom of customers of the business who had been customers or clients at any time during the period of 2 years immediately preceding the date of settlement nor to entice or attempt to entice any employee of the business from continuing to be employed in the business; 
 (k) that on settlement the First Respondent would deliver a deed of restraint whereby both the Second and Third Respondents accepted the same restraints on competition as contained in clauses (h), (i) and (j) above.</sentence>

6 It is pleaded that settlement of the purchase of the business occurred on 26 August 2005 in reliance on certain pleaded representations concerning enrolments in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">7 Around that date the applicant was unable to arrange the transfer of the telephone number of the business into the name of the applicant because it had been transferred by or on behalf of the first respondent to the Karrinyup Child Care Centre at 22 Davenport Street, Karrinyup being the other centre in Karrinyup associated with the second and third respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It is alleged that prior to settlement the first respondent had eroded the goodwill of the child care business by encouraging parents to move their children to the Karrinyup Child Care Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">8 After pleading the allegations of engagement by the first respondent in conduct that was misleading or deceptive it is also pleaded that damages are sought from the first respondent for breach of contract for not assisting in transfer of the telephone number and in not maintaining the goodwill and profitability of the business to settlement and in derogating after settlement from the purchaser's right to obtain the full benefit of the goodwill of the business.</sentence>

Clause 32 provided that the agreement would be subject to the laws of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">12 In her first affidavit, Ms Skinner deposes that there have been persistent refusals by the respondents to transfer the telephone number to the applicant with the result that she arranged an alternative telephone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Her evidence was that in the short term this caused concern among the parents and until she changed her advertising she was in fact advertising the telephone number of a competing Karrinyup Child Care Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Additionally she had prepared signage prior to the settlement date which advertised the new trading name but contained the telephone number, being the number in dispute, namely 9224 1905.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">When the respondents refused to transfer the telephone number she incurred expense in changing the signage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">13 In her first affidavit, Ms Skinner also deposes that the telephone number in question is the subject of a listing in the Yellow Pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In the 2005 Yellow Pages the number appeared as part of listings for Tommie Turtle Child Care Centres in Belmont, Karrinyup and Huntingdale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It appeared as relating to the premises in Norman Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In the 2006 Yellow Pages it appeared as one of two numbers relating to the competing Karrinyup centre in Davenport Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Her evidence was that any telephone enquiries to the number in question were being received by the competing business associated with the second and third respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">This is in the context where the applicant has paid a substantial sum for the goodwill of the business at the Norman Street premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">14 In her second affidavit, Ms Skinner deposes that an internet online search of the Yellow Pages for child care centres in Karrinyup shows the telephone number 9244 1905 as associated with the business at Norman Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In fact that number would be answered by the competing business of the respondents at 22 Davenport Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In contrast the 2006 Yellow Pages advertisement shows, as has been said, the two telephone numbers including the number in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Anyone using those references and phoning 9244 1905, would not have the availability of the current phone number of the Norman Street business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">15 Ms Skinner further deposes that on taking possession of the business and having been advised by Telstra that the business telephone number had been transferred to Karrinyup Child Care Centre, they tried to arrange transfer of the number from the vendor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In the meantime she arranged a substitute business telephone number for the Norman Street business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It was then too late to advertise in the Yellow Pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Her evidence is that the Norman Street business has the capacity to take further enrolments and that not having the telephone number previously associated with the business is critical to it, particularly at this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">She testifies that many parents are most active in seeking child care over the period from now until about mid to late February as this is the most active enrolment period for the forthcoming school year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">She further deposes that some prospective parents seeking child care would still use the 9244 1905 number in an effort to contact the Norman Street business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">This is because it is currently advertised in Yellow Pages online for that address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Also, there may be parents who wish to re-enrol students and who will have previous records of the address of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Additionally, she had distributed business cards prior to settlement on which the number in dispute had been advertised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">She further states that in her experience parents looking for child care centres view the Yellow Pages and focus on a suburb.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The consequence of the present modes of listing in the Yellow Pages is that the applicant has been deprived of telephone enquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">16 As to the steps taken by the applicant to obtain the telephone number, the evidence of Ms Skinner is that an email was sent on 29 August 2005 to the respondents' settlement agents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">A further complaint was lodged by letter dated 1 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Correspondence then continued between solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Following a letter of 25 October 2005 from the solicitors for the respondents to the solicitors for the applicant it became apparent that the possibility of a negotiated settlement and transfer of the telephone number in question was 'exhausted'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The applicant then had to consider the step of initiating proceedings which was not a step it took likely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">During November 2005 Ms Skinner and her husband 'mulled over the matter'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Ms Skinner had further discussions with the solicitors for the applicant and in early December 2005 gave instructions for an opinion to be sought with regard to the initiation of proceedings in relation to the purchase, for damages and for the transfer of the telephone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It was on 14 December 2005 that counsel was briefed and proceedings were filed on 23 December 2005 resulting in the interlocutory hearing on 13 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">17 The affidavit of Ms Dornford for the respondents is as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">She deposes that the billing address had been changed and the telephone number in issue transferred prior to settlement of the sale of the business at Norman Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">On the second occasion in which she had met Ms Skinner, Ms Skinner had confirmed that she did not wish to use the business name 'Tommie Turtle' and wished to trade under the name of 'Tiny Beez'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">18 On or about 25 July 2005, Ms Dornford received a letter together with her co-director addressed to the 'Tommie Turtle Child Care Centre' from Sensis Pty Ltd in respect of the Yellow Pages advertising program and inviting them to check the particulars of their advertising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">She deposed that as the representative of the applicant had advised there was no requirement for the 'Tommie Turtle' name she requested Sensis Pty Ltd to remove the Norman Street address from the 'Tommie Turtle' Yellow Pages advertisement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">This was at a time when all of the special conditions of the contract had not been satisfied and it was by no means certain that the applicant would proceed with the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The deadline for placing advertisements with the 2006 Yellow Pages was around 22 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">19 Approximately two weeks prior to settlement in a telephone conversation with Ms Skinner, Ms Dornford advised her that the first and second respondents would be taking the telephone number 9244 1905 to the premises of Karrinyup Child Care Centre at 22 Davenport Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Ms Skinner replied that could not be done because she had ordered signage and stationary bearing the name Tiny Beez with that telephone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Ms Dornford advised her that she had already arranged for the Yellow Pages advertising and it was too late to change it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Ms Skinner did not say anything more about it until after settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In particular, no request was made by or on behalf of the applicant for the transfer of the telephone number prior to settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">20 Prior to settlement, Ms Dornford diverted the line, 9244 1905, back to a second line at Norman Street until the date of settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">That second line was cancelled by her on 29 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The applicant wished to reconnect the second line and that occurred on 30 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">21 Ms Dornford's evidence is that she only became aware of the objection to the retention of the telephone number, 9244 1905, in the conversation referred to above that occurred two weeks prior to settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Even then the applicant had not requested the transfer of the telephone number to it and had proceeded to settlement knowing that the respondents intended to take the telephone number with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">22 So far as the applicant seeks to attribute reduction in turnover to the transfer of the telephone number in question to the respondents, Ms Dornford says that many of the actions and policies of the applicant could have contributed to the alleged loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">23 Her further evidence was that if the respondents are ordered to transfer the telephone number now, any customers referring to the 2006 Yellow Pages seeking to contact 'Tommie Turtle' will be put through to 'Tiny Beez'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">24 Mr Dornford's affidavit is generally supportive of the evidence of Ms Dornford.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">In addition he deposes that he has been told by advisors and it is his experience in business generally, that it is the responsibility of a purchaser (here the applicant) to make applications for the transfer of a business telephone number because Telstra could then make any necessary credit arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">No such application had been made to Telstra by the applicant prior to settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">WHETHER SERIOUS QUESTION TO BE TRIED 
 
25 The nub of the applicant's claim with respect to the transfer of the telephone number, 9244 1905, is that there is a breach of contract in it not having originally been transferred to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">This directs attention to the provisions in the sale agreement, the relevant portions having been set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">26 It is apparent that the applicant as purchaser waived the right to the transfer of the business name provided for in cl 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">27 The relevant provision with respect to the telephone number is that appearing in cl 4(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The question raised by the terms of the clause is whether in fact the telephone number in question was 'an asset of the Business'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Part A of the sale agreement describes the business as the goodwill of the child care centre business carried on at 21 Norman Street, Karrinyup under the name of Tommie Turtle Karrinyup Child Care Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">That latter name is identified as 'the Business Name'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">It is clear that the business name was not an asset to be transferred at settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">28 The prima face position raised by cl 4(a) is, in my opinion, that there is an obligation on the respondents as vendors to deliver to the applicant as purchaser the documents and certificates establishing or providing evidence of title and ownership to the asset comprised by the telephone number being the number associated with the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">29 The respondents state however that such cannot be the case where prior to settlement the applicant has been advised that the telephone number will not be transferred and has made no demur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The respondents have not contended that amounted to a waiver but it nevertheless relies on the evidence of non-response from Ms Skinner on behalf of the applicant to the advice that the telephone number was not included in the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">30 Further, there is some issue, not yet viewed with complete clarity, as to whether the respondents are disputing that any consideration passed for the telephone number in terms of the goodwill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Certainly the respondents contend that the mere reference to the amount of money paid for goodwill does not itself establish that the particular telephone number was included in the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">31 In my view there is a serious issue to be tried on the question of whether there was a breach of contract in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">On the face of it the contractual provisions give rise to a right, however, the full effect of the evidence on which the respondents rely cannot be determined until trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE 
 
32 The respondents contend that the applicant has not shown to the requisite standard that on the balance of convenience it should be granted an injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It relies on a number of factors which are generally finely balanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">33 First is the delay between the date of settlement and the application to the Court for interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The second affidavit of Ms Skinner makes apparent that the delay is not entirely explained by the time taken for exchange of correspondence between solicitors and others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Rather, there was at least a month when those involved in the applicant 'mulled over the matter'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The reality is that the business purchased by the applicant has been able to be contacted under the second line installed by the respondents prior to settlement and taken over after settlement by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Nevertheless, there is evidence that the business purchased by them is not yet fully enrolled and that this is an important time of the year for maximum access in terms of attracting enrolments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Further, the respondents make the point that as there never was any indication from them that they were willing to transfer the telephone number the delay in issuing proceedings for an injunction is not adequately explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Further, the respondents contend that the applicant has failed to show why the transfer of the telephone number after a period of almost five months would benefit it to a degree that would outweigh the hardship to the respondents given that it was Ms Skinner for the applicant who had advised she did not wish to use the 'Tommie Turtle' name and that number has been associated with the 'Tommie Turtle' name and now with the new premises by customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">34 Further, it is contended that the applicant has failed to show that the transfer of the telephone number would enhance the goodwill of the business to a significant degree compared to other advertising such as signs on site, newspaper advertising, electronic Yellow Pages or direct mail outs that would cause no hardship or inconvenience to the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">35 Further, it is contended for the respondents that if the Court takes the view that the applicant is entitled to the telephone number in question, transferring the telephone number after such a delay when a contrary advertisement has been placed at this stage is not the appropriate remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">36 Therefore, it is said that the applicant must prove on the balance of probabilities that not only is it entitled to the number pursuant to the sale agreement but that it has suffered at least some damage as a result of the transfer of the telephone number to new premises in circumstances where it is not sought to retain the former business name and that there is a benefit it would obtain if the telephone number was transferred back to it after a lapse of some months which would outweigh the hardship to the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The respondents submit that the applicant has not proved this to the required standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Therefore it is said this is a case where an injunction is not an appropriate remedy, and by implication damages could be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">37 For the applicant reliance is placed on the statement in RP Meagher, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity: Doctrines and Remedies 4 th edn Butterworths 2002 at 
[21-380] where it is stated:
 
 'The greater the hardship to the defendant, the greater the reluctance of the Court to grant the injunction; but, the more it is apparent that an equal or further hardship would be caused to the plaintiff by refusing an injunction, or the stronger a plaintiff's case appears, the more that reluctance will be dissipated: Beese v Woodhouse [1970] 1 All ER 769; [1971] WLR 586.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">' 

38 The applicant submits that the only stated concern of the respondents is that any customers referring to the printed 2006 Yellow Pages seeking to contact Tommie Turtle at Davenport Street will be put through to Tiny Beez being the Norman Street business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">However that is in circumstances where the online Yellow Pages displays the Norman Street address with the 9244 1905 telephone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">39 Additionally the Davenport Street business has an alternative telephone number displayed in the printed 2006 Yellow Pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">40 In contrast any customers referring to telephone records other than the printed 2006 Yellow Pages seeking to contact the child care business at Norman Street would get the competing business of the respondents at Davenport Street without an alternative telephone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">This could include people using the current Yellow Pages on-line, past customers using business cards and their own records of telephone numbers, persons using printed Yellow Pages from 2005 and earlier or old stationary, old notations and telephone numbers given on a referral basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">41 The applicant submits that given the strong merits of the case for breach of contract in favour of the applicant, the risk of any confusion generated by the deliberate act of the respondents in advertising the Norman Street telephone number should be borne by the respondents given the difficulty of the applicant in assessing damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Had the respondents retained the Norman Street address when they received the letter from Sensis Pty Ltd dated 25 July 2005, there would have been no confusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Therefore, any confusion has been created by the deliberate breach of contract of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">They, therefore, should bear the risk of any confusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">42 The applicant also contends that the conduct by the respondents in approving the printed 2006 Yellow Pages listing at that time was done in breach of cl 13 of the general conditions of the agreement for sale which provided that the vendor was to conduct the business as a going concern until settlement in order to maintain goodwill and profitability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Relevantly that portion of the agreement reads:
 
 ' 13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">CONDUCT BEFORE SETTLEMENT 
 
 
 
 The Vendor agrees to conduct the Business as a going concern at the Premises until Settlement and: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) to conduct the Business efficiently, in a proper and businesslike manner, to the best of the Vendor's skill and ability, in order to maintain goodwill and the profitability of the Business such conduct to include promotional and marketing activities normal for the current trading period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">In the event such promotional, marketing or advertising activity entails or requires forward planning, bookings for advertisement placements, brochures, catalogues and the like, then the Vendor will assist the Purchaser with such planning and the Vendor will be liable only for such portion of the costs that are relevant to the remainder of the Vendor's trading time in the Business; 
 
 
 
 
 ...' 
 

 43 Therefore the applicant submits that the other way to contrast the situation is if the printed Yellow Pages advertisement for 2006 had stayed the same as for 2005 as it did for the online Yellow Pages then anyone ringing the 9244 1905 telephone number would have known it was for the business at Norman Street and that it was still a child care centre business notwithstanding the ownership had changed and so had the business name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">44 I find these factors flowing from the submissions of both parties in relation to the balance of convenience fairly evenly balanced themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The thing that ultimately persuades me that the applicant should succeed is the submission relating to the strength of the case for contractual breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">If the respondents had any case to argue in terms of legal categories arising from the advice to the applicant that the telephone number was not being transferred and the progression of settlement in the face of that knowledge, they have not made them apparent at the stage of this interlocutory application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Consequently the prima facie position remains that the contract has been breached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The strength of that position is entitled to resonate in the balance of convenience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">I therefore do not agree with the respondents that this is a case where the balance of convenience should nevertheless be allowed to tip in the respondents favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">This is because ultimately if interlocutory relief were not granted and the matter was determined adversely to the respondents at trial, as it will appear to be likely on the issue of contractual breach so far as it can be judged at this stage, the case for not granting any relief would have then been considerably escalated because of the reasonably longer time lapse involved to enable the resolution of the dispute at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">45 For these reasons I consider that the balance of convenience does tip in favour of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Consequently the interlocutory relief should issue.</sentence>

 Introduction 
 
1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court on 9 March 2005 dismissing the appellant's challenge to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal's decision, handed down on 27 July 2004, affirmed the decision of a delegate of the respondent Minister to refuse to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Tribunal's decision involved a redetermination of the appellant's claims consequent to an order for redetermination made by the Federal Magistrates Court on 15 March 2004 (see SZAIX v Minister for Immigration [2004] FMCA 104).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Tribunal had first determined the matter against the appellant in a decision handed down on 4 April 2003 which was subsequently set aside on judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">A twice-raped, ethnic Chinese and Christian Indonesian woman 
 
2 The appellant claims to possess a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of race, religion and membership of a particular social group, said to be either Indonesian women or Chinese Christian women in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The Tribunal accepted that the appellant was raped on two separate occasions a few weeks before leaving Indonesia and arriving in Australia in July 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">At the time of the first sexual assault, the appellant's attacker told her not to inform the police of his actions lest he harm her again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The appellant's father and brother nevertheless complained to the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The appellant then moved to the home of her relatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">She claimed that she was stalked by her attacker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The second sexual assault was carried out by the same attacker and another man.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The appellant claimed that her rapists were Muslim men.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">She also claimed they were policemen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The appellant claimed her fear of persecution arose from the rapes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The appellant claimed to fear that she will be raped again should she return to Indonesia, either by the man who raped her on both occasions, or by Muslim men.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Leave to raise new grounds of appeal 
 
3 The appellant sought leave to raise grounds of appeal not argued in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">She did not press the ground argued in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">4 The amended notice of appeal in substance raises three new matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">These are: 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">That the Tribunal applied the wrong test, as follows:
 
(a) that the Tribunal misunderstood the test for assessing whether women in Indonesia were a particular social group and thereby failed to ask itself the right question when determining whether or not the appellant was owed protection obligations under section 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'); 
 
(b) that the Tribunal failed to consider whether there was a failure of effective State protection in respect of the appellant for a ground under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva, on 28 July 1951 (1954 ATS 5) ('the Convention') and therefore failed to consider an essential integer of her claim; and
 
(c) that the Tribunal misunderstood the test for assessing whether it was reasonable to expect the appellant to relocate to another part of Indonesia by failing to assess the practical realities of the appellant's relocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It thereby failed to ask itself the right questions when determining whether or not the appellant was owed protection obligations under section 36 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Further, or in the alternative to 1(c) above, that the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant considerations when assessing whether it was reasonable to expect the appellant to relocate to another part of Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">These relevant considerations were:
 
(a) the fact that in Indonesia the appellant was a single mother responsible for two children who would have no family support or protection if she moved away from Jakarta;
 
(b) the fact that the appellant had been raped twice;
 
(c) the fact that the incidence of rape of women and children in Indonesia generally is a serious problem; and
 
(d) the fact that in other parts of Indonesia prejudice against ethnic Chinese Indonesians may be stronger than in Jakarta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">This led to a failure by the Tribunal to ask itself the right questions when determining whether or not the appellant was owed protection obligations under s 36 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">That by reason of the matters set out above the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">5 In addition to the formal application to raise new grounds, other questions were debated at the hearing (for convenience I continue the numbering from the previous paragraph): 
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Did the Tribunal fail to take relevant considerations into account or misunderstand the evidence concerning the appellant's claim to possess a well-founded fear of persecution as an ethnic Chinese and Christian woman?</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Did the Tribunal misunderstand the correct test, or ask the wrong question, for determining whether reasonably effective State protection was available against the feared persecution?</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Did the Tribunal fail to apply the correct legal test, or fail to take relevant considerations into account, on the question of the availability of State protection, in relation to future protection by the police?</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 
 

6 The appellant was legally represented at the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court, but submitted in this Court that the new grounds were not raised there in circumstances where her solicitor's grasp of the legal complexities appeared to be less than fully adequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The appellant submitted, and the first respondent ('Minister') agreed, that where it is expedient and in the interests of justice to grant leave to raise new grounds on appeal, the Court should do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The appellant cited VUAX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] (' VUAX' ) (and the cases there cited) in support of her request for leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">7 However, the Minister submitted that it was open to the appellant's solicitor in the Federal Magistrates Court to consider whether to raise the grounds now sought to be argued, and that the solicitor did so consider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">An appeal should not become an inquiry into the quality of the legal advice received by a party at first instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The Minister directed the Court's attention to paragraphs [16]-[18] of the Full Court's decision in Iyer v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788 (' Iyer '), in which the Full Court canvassed relevant authorities on this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Of note is the discussion by R D Nicholson J in Jones v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 63 FCR 32 (' Jones '), where his Honour observed at 47:
 
 '...The effect of [the] authorities, as I view them, is that where the new grounds could possibly have been met by calling evidence at the hearing or may have resulted in the case of the respondent being differently conducted at the trial, leave will be refused (the first proposition).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">However, where all the facts have been established beyond controversy or where the point is one of construction or of law, then it is a question for the Court of Appeal whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice to entertain the point (the second proposition).</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">... 
 ... 
 The authorities...while stressing the importance of the public interest in ensuring the finality of litigation, do not view that interest as likely to be paramount where the new grounds are within the second proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Lord Watson in Connecticut [ Fire Insurance Co v Cavanaugh [1892] AC 473] at 480 said that in the case of the second proposition "it is not only competent but expedient in the interests of justice, to entertain the plea".</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The rule derives, at least in part, "from public policy considerations directed to ensuring the finality of litigation" and, so far as it does so derive, "the relevant consideration is that the case sought to be made on appeal is a new or different case from that which emerged at the trial": Banque Commerciale SA [(En liq) v Akhil Holdings Ltd [1990] HCA 11 ; (1990) 169 CLR 279] at 284.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">' 
 

8 The Minister submitted that on this issue the Court must have regard to the interest held by her, and through her, the Australian people, in the finality of the procedures put in place for the determination of entitlements to protection visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In addition, the Court should have regard to the protection of the 'structure and integrity of the appellate process' (see Iyer at [23]), to which it is relevant, though not determinative, that the appellant failed to comply with Court deadlines for providing reasons why the grounds were not raised below, and particulars of the arguments relied upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">9 The appellant argued that her request for leave is supported by these factors: the facts are not in dispute and there is no possible need to admit new evidence for the new grounds (as in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1) (' Coulton '); granting leave would not be an effective grant of a new trial (also as in Coulton ); and the new grounds raised were involved as parts of the appellant's claim before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">She referred to Jones , where, as here, there was an express disavowal of grounds by the relevant legal representative, but the Court nevertheless granted the appellant leave to raise new grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">10 At the hearing, counsel for the appellant relied on Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146, suggesting that it is authority for the principle that the requirements of case management are relevant considerations, but they cannot be used to prevent a party from arguing a ground that is fairly arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Further, counsel suggested that there is a level of disagreement in this Court regarding the approach to be taken to this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">In doing so, counsel referred to the judgment of Allsop J in Branir v Owston Nominees (No 2) [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at 440, in which his Honour expressly declined to comment on the approach taken by Branson and Katz JJ in H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2000) 63 ALD 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In that case, their Honours gave consideration to the merits of the new grounds to be raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">On this point, counsel also referred to the discussion in VUAX at [48] where, it appears, the Full Court accepted that the merits of the new grounds are to be given consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The appellant argued that a party should be permitted to raise an arguable case provided any prejudice to other parties could be compensated by costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In addition, the appellant referred to the judgment of R D Nicholson J in Jones , where his Honour stated (at 48) that whether or not the Immigration Review Tribunal had complied with its statutory duty 'raises a point of law in the interests of justice which supports and outweighs, in all the circumstances, the public interest in the finality of litigation in these particular circumstances'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Jenkinson J (with whom Carr J agreed) similarly stated (at 37) that the '[o]bservance of such [statutory] requirements by a tribunal administering important and publicly scrutinised immigration laws should be encouraged by this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">A determination whether...the Tribunal satisfied those requirements is in my opinion expedient and in the interests of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">'
 
11 In NAJT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 I gave my views as follows (at [162]-[166]), Conti J generally agreeing:
 
 'Quite apart from a power to receive new evidence, what is the position of an appellate court rehearing a matter as to questions of law available on the materials before the trial judge but not raised at first instance?</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">An appellant wishing to raise fresh legal questions cannot, in the first place, be in a worse position than one seeking to augment the evidence itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Secondly, a party victorious at first instance is, in any case, liable to be defeated by a change in the law occurring before the appeal is heard; that, indeed, is conventionally given as the main practical difference between a "strict" appeal and one by way of rehearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The result of a new legal point being successfully raised is no harder for the litigant thereby defeated than if the defeat follows from some legal point newly raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Thirdly, however, there is undoubtedly great, general value in considerations of finality of litigation acting as a brake on appellate intervention, thereby preserving the integrity of the trial as the normal arena for final disposition of that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">As a general statement of principle there is no conflict between what the Full Court approved in Branir and the approach in the cases next referred to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
 In my respectful view, the correct approach, and the one generally adopted in practice in this Court, is that succinctly expressed in VUAX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 (" VUAX ") by Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ (at [46] --- [48]): 
 
 
 
 
 "Leave to argue a ground of appeal not raised before the primary judge should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so: O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310; H v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs ; and Branir ... at [20]-[24] and [38].</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In Coulton ..., Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ observed, in their joint judgment, at 7 : 
 
 
 
 
 
 'It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 The practice of raising arguments for the first time before the Full Court has been particularly prevalent in appeals relating to migration matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below, but which clearly has merit, is advanced, and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Where, however, there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">" (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">) 
 
 
 
 
 To similar effect, in Iyer ... Heerey, Moore and Goldberg JJ said (at [22] --- [24]): 
 
 
 
 
 
 "... We recognise that there is a particular sensitivity in refugee cases where an adverse decision may have very serious consequences for an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Although it is in the interests of justice that decisions be made on the true merits of the case sought to be argued, the structure and integrity of the appellate process must also be taken into consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It is incumbent upon parties bringing applications to the Court to review decisions of tribunals such as the [Tribunal] to make it clear from the outset what are the substantive grounds of review relied upon .... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 However, in order to determine whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice that leave be given to argue new grounds it is necessary to give some consideration to the merits of the grounds raised .</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">That does not mean that an appellate court should enter upon a full consideration of the grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">To do so would make the requirement for leave meaningless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It is sufficient to determine whether the grounds sought to be raised have a reasonable prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">We also consider it appropriate to take into account whether the appellant had the benefit of legal representation at the hearing before the primary judge .</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">" (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">) 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 Thus, relevant questions include: 
 
 
 
 
 1) Do the new legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success?</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 
 2) Is there an acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below?</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 
 3) How much dislocation to the Court and efficient use of judicial sitting time is really involved?</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 
 
 
 4) What is at stake in the case for the appellant?</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 
 
 
 
 5) Will the resolution of the issues raised have any importance beyond the case at hand?</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">
 
 6) Is there any actual prejudice, not viewing the notion of prejudice narrowly, to the respondent?</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 
 
 
 7) If so, can it be justly and practicably cured?</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 
 
 
 
 8) If not, where, in all the circumstances, do the interests of justice lie?</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">' (Original emphasis).</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 
 
 
 

12 I proceed to examine the various attacks sought to be raised against the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Issue 4: Ethnic Chinese and Christian women in Indonesia as a particular social group 
 
13 The Tribunal accepted that the rapes suffered by the appellant constituted harm of a kind sufficiently serious so as to amount to persecution under s 91R(1)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The Tribunal further accepted that 'ethnic Chinese women' in Indonesia are a particular social group within the Convention's meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">14 However, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant was raped for reasons of her membership of that group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Nor was the Tribunal satisfied that the appellant's fear of future persecution was for this reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The Tribunal accepted that riots which took place in Indonesia in 1998 were marked by mass rape of ethnic Chinese women but found that the independent sources it consulted 'do not suggest' that the targeting of ethnic Chinese women persisted beyond the 1998 riots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It concluded that there was 'no evidence' to suggest that ethnic Chinese women are singled out for sexual assault.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The Tribunal found that the 'prevalent and indiscriminate nature of such [sexual] attacks suggests that these attacks are opportunistic crimes committed for individualistic reasons against women perceived to be suitable victims'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It found there 'was nothing in the [appellant's] evidence' to lead it to conclude that in committing the rapes, the appellant's attackers were 'essentially and significantly motivated by her membership of the particular social group of ethnic Chinese women'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">15 The Tribunal's findings on this question were as follows:
 
 'The [appellant] claims to be fearful of the man primarily responsible for her rape and sexual assault.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The Tribunal has already found that the [appellant] was not attacked for the reason of her religion, ethnicity or membership of a particular social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The [appellant's] evidence at the hearing regarding the reasons as to why her attacker would want to harm her now was unambiguous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">She stated that that the man wants to harm her because he was upset that her father had reported the matter to the police and he wants to take revenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">When she was asked again if the man wanted to harm her in retaliation for her father's complaint, she said yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In the Tribunal's view, the essential and significant reason for the harm feared by the [appellant] is personal, namely revenge or retaliation for her father's complaint to the police and not any Convention related reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The Tribunal finds that the harm feared by the [appellant] is not Convention related [sic].</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">' 
 

16 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal's reasoning demonstrates that it failed to understand both the nature of this part of her claim and the evidence relating to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Whilst the Tribunal had said there was 'no evidence' to suggest that ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia are singled out for sexual assault, it did accept there was a 'general vulnerability felt by the ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In light of this acceptance, the Tribunal was obliged to deal with the appellant's claim that ethnic Chinese are likely to be targets of violence, and the evidence in support of that claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">There was evidence that, although government administrations have been more benevolent towards ethnic Chinese since 1998, ethnic Chinese, and Christians, have been targets of violence since that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The appellant submitted that the Tribunal jurisdictionally erred by not making findings on that evidence (which included a suggestion that Chinese women frequently wore chastity belts, such was their fear of rape), and thereby not considering it relevant in reaching its conclusion on this part of her claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">17 In concluding that there was no evidence to support a finding that ethnic Chinese women were singled out for sexual assault, the Tribunal referred to evidence submitted by the appellant that according to a non-government organisation 'sexual violence, including rape, mostly against women and children, could take place anywhere and involve anyone regardless of walk of life, education or age'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The appellant submitted that this did not undermine her claim: evidence that many women in Indonesia are at risk of rape does not deny that ethnic Chinese women may possess a well-founded fear of rape on grounds of their being ethnic Chinese.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">18 In response, the Minister argued two things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">First, that the Court should not read literally the Tribunal's use of the phrase 'no evidence': reading the Tribunal's reasons reasonably beneficially, it is clear enough that the Tribunal meant that there was no evidence it found convincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Second, and perhaps more importantly, that the validity of the intended ground of the appellant's appeal is immaterial, given that the Tribunal concluded that the essential and significant reason for the future harm feared by the appellant was not related to a Convention reason but was personal: she fears that she will be harmed again by her attacker in revenge for her father's complaint to the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">19 In my opinion, given the Tribunal's factual findings the Minister's submissions must be upheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">In the first place, the Tribunal's finding as to the true nature of the appellant's fear was a free-standing and sufficient reason to reject her claim to refugee status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">(There is a qualification to this as to the claim that, at street level, no adequate State protection via the police is available to the appellant, the lack being attributable to Convention reasons, but this is dealt with below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">On that finding, the persecution she feared was not for a Convention reason --- the Tribunal member rejected the hypothesis that the appellant was attacked because she was Chinese.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">It follows that she could not have been attacked because she was a member of the social group, ethnic Chinese women, found by the Tribunal to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">20 Secondly, read as a whole, and beneficially, the Tribunal's reasons sufficiently indicate that by 'no evidence' the Tribunal meant 'no sufficient reason'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Such an assessment was legally within the Tribunal's province.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">21 Thirdly, it is now trite that the Tribunal was only required to refer to the evidence it found persuasive and not to explain its rejection of each other piece of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Issue 1(a): Women in Indonesia as a particular social group 
 
22 The appellant claimed that she was persecuted on the grounds of her membership of the particular social group of women in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The Tribunal found that women in Indonesia did not constitute a particular social group within the Convention's meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The appellant argued that the Tribunal misunderstood the legal test for a 'particular social group'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">23 The Tribunal found that whilst the evidence 'indicates that violence against women in Indonesia is pervasive and women face considerable discrimination in the work place' it also 'suggests Indonesian women are active participants in Indonesian society'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The Tribunal found that Indonesian women participate in education, the work force and politics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Based on a 'country report' from the State Department of the United States of America, the Tribunal stated that whilst the Indonesian Guidelines of State Policy and legal statutes adopted by the MPR (People's Consultative Assembly) state that women's participation in the development process must not conflict with their role in improving family welfare and the education of the younger generation, the Guidelines explicitly state that women have the same rights, obligations, and opportunities as men.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The Tribunal then concluded that women in Indonesia are not a particular social group within the meaning of the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Nowhere in the section of the Tribunal's decision headed 'Findings and Reasons' did the Tribunal expressly refer to the question of whether Indonesian women are cohesive or share interests, goals or aspirations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The Tribunal did however, in the course of recording the evidence later referred to by it in its 'Findings and Reasons' on the question of 'a particular social group', record that the appellant was invited at the hearing to comment on the assertion that Indonesian women did not share interests, goals or aspirations but did not so comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">24 In seeking to determine whether women in Indonesia are 'a particular social group', the Tribunal referred to Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225, and quoted the following passage from the judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ in Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387 (' Applicant S ') at [36]:
 
 '...First, the group must be identifiable by a characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Secondly, the characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group cannot be the shared fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Thirdly, the possession of that characteristic or attribute must distinguish the group from society at large.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Borrowing the language of Dawson J in Applicant A , a group that fulfils the first two propositions, but not the third, is merely a "social group" and not a "particular social group".</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">' (Footnotes omitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">)
 

The Tribunal then took the following approach to the question of whether 'a particular social group' exists: 'Whether a supposed group is a "particular social group" in a society will depend upon all of the evidence including relevant information regarding legal, social, cultural and religious norms in the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">'
 
25 The appellant did not challenge the correctness of the approach to 'a particular social group' stated by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">However, she argued that the Tribunal manifestly misunderstood that approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The appellant submitted that the written reasons of the Tribunal demonstrate that in considering the third matter identified in the quote from Applicant S above (ie whether the social group was distinguishable from the rest of society), the Tribunal actually tested whether women in Indonesia were cohesive or 'share interests, goals or aspirations'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The appellant pointed out that cohesiveness is not a necessary element of a particular social group; thus the Tribunal misunderstood the test to be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The Minister argued that the Tribunal's written reasons on 'a particular social group' demonstrate that the Tribunal gave significance to the integration of women into civil society and the conferral on them of the same rights and obligations as men, and not the cohesiveness or otherwise of Indonesian women as a social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">26 A fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons as a whole does not leave me with the impression that the Tribunal, under cover of silence, applied a test of whether women in Indonesian were cohesive or shared interests, goals or aspirations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Decision-makers, including judges, often raise issues and considerations in the course of a hearing that ultimately do not form part of their reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">So it was, in my opinion, here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">27 Further, the appellant is faced with the problem that the Tribunal concluded that the information it accepted 'does not indicate that perpetrators of sexual assault in Indonesia engage in this form of abhorrent criminal activity as a means of harming or persecuting ethnic Chinese women (or women) per se for that matter ' (the emphasis is mine but the punctuation is as in the original).</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Thereby, notwithstanding its finding that women in Indonesia are not a particular social group, the Tribunal appears to have concluded that, if they were, perpetrators of sexual assault do not commit their crimes as a matter of persecuting women as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The appellant asserts that the parenthetical 'allusion' to women in the Tribunal's conclusion is not sufficient to constitute a finding on this question, but I see no reason to read down what the Tribunal Member clearly enough said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The mispunctuation leads nowhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Issues 1(b), 5 and 6: The unavailability for Convention reasons of State protection against the feared persecution 
 
28 After rejecting the appellant's claims that her rapists were policemen, the Tribunal found:
 
 'The independent evidence...indicates that the state authorities are attempting to address the prevalence of rape in Indonesia by identifying the problem of under-reporting and establishing crises centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">According to the US State Department, in 2003 there was a 25 percent increase in the rape cases tallied by the Jakarta police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Rape is punishable by 4 to 12 years in jail, and the Government jailed perpetrators for rape and attempted rape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">During 2003, many police stations set up a "special crisis room" (RPK), where female officers received criminal reports from sexual assault victims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">There is an active NGO movement in the country which is constantly raising awareness and assists in police in addressing the problem of sexual assault [sic] '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">
 

29 The Tribunal concluded that the Indonesian authorities do not 'generally' promote, condone, or permit the persecution of, or 'withhold reasonable protection' from, Chinese, Christians or ethnic Chinese and Christian women.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">It referred to evidence that recently a police chief in West Jakarta was replaced for allegedly blackmailing traders of traditional Chinese medicines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The Tribunal said that '[t]here was nothing in the independent evidence to satisfy the Tribunal that the [appellant] will be denied state protection for the reason of her ethnicity, religion or her membership of a particular social group of "ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">' The Tribunal was 'satisfied that if the [appellant] were to face harm from private individuals, adequate and effective state protection is available to her'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">30 The appellant submitted that, even if, upon analysis, she feared persecution only by a non-State actor for non-Convention reasons, the Tribunal erred by failing to consider whether there had been a failure by the Indonesian authorities, for Convention reasons, to provide protection to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The appellant relied on the observation in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 205 ALR 487 (' S152 ') that a state's inability to control the conduct of its police force may amount to a sufficient reason for a person to be unwilling to avail herself of the protection of her country of nationality once outside the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">That, however, assumes that a Convention reason is implicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">In oral submissions, the appellant submitted that, had the Tribunal applied the correct test, it would have been open to it to conclude that the failure by the authorities to protect the appellant was for a Convention reason: the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 (' Khawar ') is authority for the proposition that criminal activity committed by a private individual, which is tolerated or condoned by the State because it systematically discriminates on Convention grounds, may amount to persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">31 In considering whether effective state protection was available, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal was required to consider whether there was a reasonably effective and impartial police force and a reasonably impartial system of justice: see S152 at [26].</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The appellant argued that the Tribunal's reasoning reveals no consideration of whether effective state protection was available to the appellant 'on the ground' or at a 'micro' level, as was required: the question was, what would be available as a practical matter to a woman in the position of the appellant?</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">32 The appellant submitted that, had the Tribunal really questioned whether there was an effective and impartial police force and a reasonably impartial system of justice, as required by S152 , it would have dealt with the suggestion by the appellant's father that the police had not responded to his complaint of his daughter's rape because she is Chinese, and that the appellant was raped again after the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">33 The Minister conceded that the evidence dealt with by the Tribunal on the issue of state protection consisted of 'broad' considerations of what the state was attempting to do to remedy the problems of rape in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">However, the Minister submitted, that does not betoken jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The Tribunal was under no obligation to recite every piece of evidence before it, and especially not required to recite evidence it found unconvincing on an issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The Tribunal's conclusion that the Indonesian authorities do not 'generally' withhold protection should not be 'parsed' in order to concoct supposed error: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The Convention does not require absolute protection or guarantees against harm, as was correctly observed by the Tribunal in reaching its conclusion on the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">34 The Minister further argued that in a case of persecution by non-state agents the question of state protection may be relevant at three stages of the inquiry: whether the fear is well-founded; whether the conduct giving rise to the fear is persecution, and; whether the appellant is unable, or, owing to fear of persecution, unwilling, to avail herself of the protection of her state: S152 per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ at [21].</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">It was for this reason that the High Court allowed an appeal from the judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court in S152 that turned on a finding, similar to the appellant's argument in this appeal, that the Tribunal erred in failing to determine whether there was protection available 'in a practical sense'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">35 However, while the 'ability of the state to discharge its obligation to protect its citizens', may , as counsel for the Minister submitted, be relevant at three stages of the inquiry, it is here, in my view, relevant to the second question identified by Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ, viz 'whether the conduct giving rise to the fear is persecution' (at [21]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">If the state, despite the good intentions of its leaders, is not able, at what might be called the operational or grass-roots level, to have its operatives provide an acceptable level of protection against serious harm, and the dereliction of those operatives has as its basis their discrimination of a Convention kind against the appellant, that situation, as Hale LJ put it in Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000] 1 NLR 15, 'may turn the acts of others [ie non-state actors] into persecution for a Convention reason' (at 52 and quoted with approval by Lord Hope of Craighead in the appeal to the House of Lords (see [2000] UKHL 37 ; [2001] 1 AC 489 at 497)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">36 So much was uncontroversial in S152 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">S152 was a case where harm had been inflicted by non-state actors for Convention reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The majority in the High Court took the view that (at [26]):
 
 ' [n] o country can guarantee that its citizens will at all times, and in all circumstances, be safe from violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Day by day, Australian courts deal with criminal cases involving violent attacks on person or property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Some of them may occur for reasons of racial or religious intolerance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The religious activities in which the first respondent engaged ... evidently aroused the anger of some other people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Their response was unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The Ukrainian state was obliged to take reasonable measures to protect the lives and safety of its citizens, and those measures would include an appropriate criminal law, and the provision of a reasonably effective and impartial police force and justice system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">None of the country information before the tribunal justified a conclusion that there was a failure on the part of Ukraine to conform to its obligations in that respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">' 
 

37 In the present case, by contrast, (if the matter were sufficiently raised by the appellant), although the serious harm done to her by a non-state agent was not itself inflicted for a Convention reason, she might nevertheless be refugee if, for Convention reasons, namely, anti-Chinese racism merging into antipathy for Chinese women considered as a social group exhibited by the local police, the State failed, to provide a 'reasonably effective and impartial police force' (cf S152 at [26]) at a grass-roots level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">That is, the State's weakness or incompetence, whatever its leaders' good intention, in having its norms carried out, might have permitted the local police to engage in Convention persecution themselves, by failure (for Convention reasons) to prevent and act against those who would cause the appellant serious harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">38 As I read S152 , nothing in it, or otherwise in principle, denies that such a claim, if made out, may constitute the appellant a refugee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">She would be in her predicament because of the risk of serious harm coming to her for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">As the Convention definition puts it (see Article 1(A)(2)), she would be: 
 
 '...owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for [Convention reasons] ... outside the country of [her] nationality and ... , owing to such fear ... unwilling to avail [herself] of the protection of that country'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">
 

39 As the 'Michigan Guidelines', developed by Professor Hathaway and others, put it:
 
 'The causal link between the applicant's predicament and a Convention ground will be revealed by evidence of the reasons which led either to the infliction or threat of a relevant harm, or which cause the applicant's country of origin to withhold effective protection in the face of a privately inflicted risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Attribution of the Convention ground to the applicant by the state or non-governmental agent of persecution is sufficient to establish the required causal connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">' (See: Hathaway, 'The Michigan Guidelines on Nexus to a Convention Ground', Michigan Journal of International Law (2002) vol 23, pp 211-222 at 215.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">)
 

40 More specifically and authoritatively, in Khawar it was recognised that, as Gleeson CJ put it (at [30] --- [31]):
 
 'The references in the authorities to state agents of persecution and non-state agents of persecution should not be understood as constructing a strict dichotomy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Persecution may also result from the combined effect of the conduct of private individuals and the state or its agents; and a relevant form of state conduct may be tolerance or condonation of the inflicting of serious harm in circumstances where the state has a duty to provide protection against such harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">As was noted earlier, this is not a case in which it is necessary to deal with mere inability to provide protection; this is a case of alleged tolerance and condonation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">In Ex parte Shah , Lord Hoffmann, in giving the example of the Jewish shopkeeper set upon with impunity by business rivals in Nazi Germany, referred to the failure of the authorities to provide protection, based upon race, as an "element in the persecution".</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The same expression was used by Lord Hope of Craighead in the passage from Horvath quoted above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">
 
 Where persecution consists of two elements, the criminal conduct of private citizens, and the toleration or condonation of such conduct by the state or agents of the state, resulting in the withholding of protection which the victims are entitled to expect, then the requirement that the persecution be by reason of one of the Convention grounds may be satisfied by the motivation of either the criminals or the state.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">In relation to the case which Ms Khawar seeks to make out, the decision in Ex parte Shah in this respect is directly in point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">If her contentions, as to which no findings have yet been made, are correct, then Ms Khawar was being abused by her husband and his relatives for personal reasons, but her likely subjection to further abuse without state protection is by reason of her membership of a particular social group , if it be the case that women in Pakistan may be so described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">' (Footnotes omitted, emphasis added.</sentence>

 See also Khawar at [79]-[80], [87] and [114] ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">41 S152 effected no modification of Khawar .</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">
 
42 I turn now to the question: was the claim that the police at the local level had treated the appellant's complaint of rape with less than due seriousness for Convention reasons sufficiently raised so as to require the Tribunal to deal with it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">In my opinion it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">43 The Tribunal had before it material from the appellant's father which she and her father had wished to have considered by the relevant Australian authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Her father suggested that he was treated differently and less favourably, when he complained, by the local police, Muslims, because he was Chinese.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">It was elsewhere asserted in the materials relied on by the appellant that all the police are Muslims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The Refugee Advice and Casework Service (Australia) Inc ('RACS') had submitted on behalf of the appellant that she 'fears that the police and authorities in Indonesia will not protect her because of the fact she is a Christian Chinese...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Her solicitor had also submitted that the appellant's father had provided a statement detailing his experience with the police: 'He reported the matter to the police who took no action, he opined that it was due to the fact that he and his daughter were Chinese whereas the police and the rapist were Muslim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">' The appellant's solicitor, citing Khawar (at [29]), submitted that '[o]n its face, this is a further case of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Even if the original rape was not for a convention reason, the failure of the authorities to investigate and take action in respect of the rape can amount to persecution if such inaction was motivated by questions of race.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">' The Tribunal Member who first heard the appellant's case recorded that the appellant had 'also stated that her father and brother had reported the assault to the police but they took no action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The Indonesian authorities were not interested in protecting her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">' The Tribunal Member asked the appellant 'how, in her view, the police could have done anything without more information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">' According to the Member, the appellant did not respond to that question, but 'reiterated that the complaint was ignored because she was of Chinese descent so was ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">There were fights between Muslims and Chinese Christians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">'
 
44 The Tribunal appears to have accepted the appellant's claim that her attacker was a threat to her on account of her complaint to the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">It was also apparently accepted, at least, that the appellant had been raped; that this had been reported to the police; that they had, at best, done nothing useful directed towards apprehending the rapist, and that she had been raped again by the same man on account of the complaint to the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">45 In such circumstances, it behoved the Tribunal, in light of the several ways in which the appellant put her case, to examine whether the appellant might qualify for refugee status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">There is nothing abstruse or indirect in the proposition, which readily springs to mind, that despite anti-racist sentiments expressed and progress initiated at the highest levels of government, these may have had little effect at local police level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">46 This question should have been considered but was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It is true that the Tribunal found that:
 
 ' [T] he independent evidence ... indicates that the state authorities are attempting to address the prevalence of rape in Indonesia by identifying the problem of under-reporting and establishing crisis centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">... During 2003, many police stations set up a "special crisis room" (RPK), where female officers received criminal reports from sexual assault victims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">There is an active NGO movement in the country which is constantly raising awareness and assists in police addressing the problem of sexual assault [sic] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">' 
 
 
 
 

47 Apparently on that basis, the Tribunal continued:
 
 'The evidence before the Tribunal suggests that the Indonesian authorities do not generally promote, condone or permit persecution of [Chinese] , Christians or ethnic Chinese and Christian women in Indonesia or withhold reasonable protection, regardless of the position of the perpetrators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">The Tribunal notes that according to the US Department of State recently a police chief in West Jakarta was replaced for allegedly blackmailing traders of traditional Chinese medicines (see for example Country Reports on Human Rights Practices --- 2003, released by Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and labour, US Department of State, February 2004).</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The Tribunal is satisfied that if the [appellant] were to face harm from private individuals, adequate and effective state protection is available to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The Convention does not require absolute protection of an individual and state protection by no means implies that the authorities must or can provide absolute guarantees against harm ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S157/2003 [2004] HCA 18 at [26] and [28]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">There was nothing in the independent evidence to satisfy the Tribunal that the [appellant] will be denied state protection for the reason of her ethnicity, religion or her membership of a particular social group of "ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">' 
 

48 However, the appellant's claims and submissions mandated an inquiry into the prospect that she might be denied reasonable protection from the police charged with responsibilities in the area where she lived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">That question is distinct from whether at high levels or in other places in Indonesia the authorities were generally doing their reasonable, non-racist best.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Material from her father and from the appellant supported the proposition that the police at local level would treat her less favourably than indigenous Indonesians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The extent to which actual and practical, as distinct from legal, discrimination might operate against Chinese people, including women complaining of rape, appears to have provoked little, if any information at all as a result of the Tribunal's inquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">It appears not to have been, as it should have been, an actual focus of those inquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">49 Plainly the appellant's complaint about the local police, in the context of much material to suggest deep wells of anti-Chinese feeling in Muslim Indonesia, was not answered merely by reference to changes for the better at high levels of public administration in Indonesia since the departure of President Soeharto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">That the contemporary leaders of a society have enlightened views may say nothing about the situation at the level of grass-roots policing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Nor was it answered, as the Minister submitted, by reference to measures, apparently instituted in some localities, to address the general problem of rape by 'identifying the problem of under-reporting and establishing crisis centres'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The official encouragement of the reporting of rapes generally carries no implication that subsequent investigation would proceed on a basis that was not ethnically discriminatory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Encouragement of Indonesians generally to report rape to local police is one thing, the investigation by local police of reports by Chinese Indonesians is another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">50 The unexamined question was, in my opinion, sufficiently clearly an integer of her case to require consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">If it was not clearly and expressly so asserted in the ways referred to at [44] above, in my view it clearly arose on the materials before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">In NABE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 219 ALR 27 (' NABE ') the Full Court said (at [61]): 
 
 'We are of the view that the observations by Merkel J in Paramananthan , by the Full Courts in Sellamuthu and Sarrazola (No 2) and by Cooper J in SDAQ are consistent with the proposition that the tribunal is not required to consider a case that is not expressly made or does not arise clearly on the materials before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The tribunal's obligation is not limited to procedural fairness in responding to expressly articulated claims but, as is apparent from Dranichnikov , extends to reviewing the delegate's decision on the basis of all the materials before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">' 
 

51 Earlier the Full Court had approved (at [60]) some pertinent observations by Selway J in SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 199 ALR 364 at [17]-[18] : 
 
 '...But this does not mean that the application is to be treated as an exercise in nineteenth century pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">... 
 The question, ultimately, is whether the case put by the appellant before the tribunal has sufficiently raised the relevant issue that the tribunal should have dealt with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">' 


It would be strange if a claimant of refugee status were to be denied a right to have the substance of her claim considered, including the different ways in which the Convention might apply to her, because she had failed clearly to analyse those ways in her application and supporting material, although she had clearly enough delineated facts that might attract the salvation of the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">It is not likely that the Full Court in NABE intended such a thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">The Full Court was absolving the Tribunal from any duty to engage in subtle teasing out of hypotheses that only abstrusely arise from an applicant's account of the circumstances that have led to the claim of refugee status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">That is not the position here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">52 In my opinion, nothing in NABE was intended to deny, nor can it be denied, that to determine whether a claim 'clearly arises' on the material before a decision-maker, the decision-maker must fully understand the claim being made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">That, in turn, may in some cases make it necessary for the decision-maker to analyse what the appellant has said in terms of possible Convention categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">That was the position here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">53 In my opinion, failure to consider this matter constituted a constructive failure to exercise the Tribunal's jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">54 Nevertheless, whether such error ultimately has the effect of invalidating the Tribunal's decision depends on whether there was otherwise an independent, jurisdictionally robust basis, among those found by the Tribunal, for denying the appellant's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">In particular, the finding that the appellant feared persecution at the hands of one local man and that the appellant could avoid such threat as he might pose by relocating elsewhere in Indonesia is of potential significance here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Issue 1(c): Relocation 
 
55 The Tribunal Member's finding on this issue was:
 
 'Moreover, if the [appellant] remains fearful of her attackers in Jakarta, the Tribunal is satisfied that it is reasonable for the [appellant] to relocate to a different part of Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The focus of the Convention definition is not upon the protection that the country of nationality might be able to provide in some particular region, but upon a more general notion of protection by that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The international community is not under an obligation to provide protection outside the borders of the country of nationality if real protection can be found within those borders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Therefore, even if an applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution in their home region, the Convention does not provide protection if they could nevertheless avail themselves of the real protection of their country of nationality elsewhere within that country: Randhawa ... per Black CJ at 440-1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">
 The [appellant's] fear of harm is localised in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">The Tribunal does not accept that the man who assaulted her, although he may have persisted in locating her in Jakarta, would be able to find her anywhere in a densely populated country like Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">When the option of relocation was discussed with the [appellant] at the hearing, she stated that her husband had died, she was defrauded financially and most of her relatives are in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">While the Tribunal appreciates that the death of her husband in January 2001 and being financially defrauded soon after made life difficult for her, the [appellant] continued to work as [a real estate] agent until her departure from Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">She also possesses skills as a hairdresser and worked in that profession for many years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">In Australia, she was able to work until she was detained and has been able to find resourceful friends who have assisted her throughout her ordeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">The Tribunal did not find her to be as dependent as her witness tried to portray her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">She is relatively young, she was working in Indonesia prior to her departure and she has gained additional skills in Australia which would assist her if she were to search for employment opportunities elsewhere in Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The Tribunal finds that it is reasonable for the [appellant] to relocate internally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">' 
 
 
 
 

56 The present and well-entrenched state of Full Federal Court authority is that a claim to refugee status is not established by those who could reasonably avail themselves of the real protection of the country of nationality elsewhere within their country of nationality: Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 (' Randhawa' ) per Black CJ at 440 (cf my remarks in dissent in NALZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 320 ; (2004) 140 FCR 270 at [8] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">The question is whether the person can relocate to another area of the country, and, it is said, whether he or she could reasonably be expected to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">However, answering this question is influenced by the principle that: 
 
 'notwithstanding that real protection from persecution may be available elsewhere within the country of nationality, a person's fear of persecution in relation to that country will remain well-founded with respect to the country as a whole if, as a practical matter, the part of the country in which protection is available is not reasonably accessible to that person' (per Black CJ in Randhawa at 442).</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">
 

57 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal incorrectly took a general approach that there must be a safe haven somewhere in Indonesia, and did not consider, as a matter of practical reality, the issues raised by the appellant as required ( Randhawa at 443).</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The appellant submitted that the specific issues which the Tribunal was obliged, but failed to consider were:
 
 
 
 1. the psychological difficulties of continuing to live anywhere within a country and culture in which the appellant had experienced rape on two occasions;
 2. the appellant's need, as a single mother (her husband having died in January 2001), for the support of her family;
 3. the appellant may face discrimination and/or harm living as a single woman with children without any family protection;
 4. the appellant has never lived outside Cenkarang (apparently a suburb of Jakarta) in Indonesia as a single woman; and
 5. the only family the appellant has who are outside Cenkarang live in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The Tribunal did not advert to the fact that all of the appellant's relatives living in Indonesia live in Cenkarang.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">
 
 

58 The Tribunal also failed to take into account its finding that the incidence of rape of women in Indonesia generally is a problem and the fact of a general social prejudice against ethnic Chinese Indonesians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">These are probable issues for the appellant, who would effectively be without family support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">In oral submissions counsel added that the Tribunal did not take into account that the appellant may have her children with her if she relocates, unlike her experience in Australia, which had encouraged the Tribunal to regard her as a relatively resilient person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">59 The Minister denied the claim that the Tribunal merely assumed there was a safe haven within Indonesia, and argued that it is for the Tribunal to determine the significant issues in assessing the matter of relocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">It cannot be assumed that, because the Tribunal has failed to refer expressly to an issue, it has failed to consider it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">The proper inference is that the issues referred to by counsel for the appellant were not considered by the Tribunal to be as significant as those the Tribunal mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Also, of the issues listed by the appellant's counsel, factors (1) and (3) go to whether the appellant would want to live in Indonesia at all, rather than to whether she could relocate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Issues (2) and (5) concern the appellant's wish to have family support, which was acknowledged by the Tribunal, and issue (4) could properly be considered not to carry great weight, given that the appellant had successfully made her way in the unfamiliar cultural environment in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">The brevity, it was submitted, of the Tribunal's reasons on this matter 'does not detract from the breadth of the consideration'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">60 In NAIZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 37 (' NAIZ ') at [22], Branson J (with whom North J agreed) found jurisdictional error on the part of a Tribunal Member who, though acknowledging that internal relocation should be 'reasonable' in the circumstances:
 
 '...did not, as ... Randhawa [at] [16] ... requires, give consideration to the practical realities facing the appellant [a widow of advancing years] with respect to accommodation and care should she seek to relocate within Fiji ... the Tribunal was required to give consideration to how, in a practical sense, the appellant could be expected to relocate within Fiji.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">' 
 

61 Here, the appellant was a Chinese Christian widow with young children who had been twice raped and who had never lived in Indonesia outside Jakarta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">True it is that she was enterprising and employable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">But on the material accepted by the Tribunal, anti-Chinese sentiment runs deep in Indonesia and the vulnerability of women to rape appears, from the Tribunal's findings, to be high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">62 It requires little empathy to understand that, although the appellant's precise fear of persecution as identified by the Tribunal relates to one man in Jakarta, she may well now suffer profound psychological difficulty in readjusting to Indonesian society and adjusting to a new place of residence in Indonesia at some place where, ex hypothesi , she appears likely to have no close family support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">To observe that she had suffered an 'ordeal', yet appeared capable in Australia, where the social environment is entirely different and she has family support, is simply not to acknowledge the major difficulty in the 'practical realities', both psychological and physical, that now would confront her if returned to Indonesia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Who would befriend her?</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">What support, if any, would be available?</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Would she be able to speak freely about her troubles (there is a suggestion in her materials, unexplored by the Tribunal, that even in Chinese-Indonesian circles shame attaches to a sexually assaulted woman)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Is a Chinese widow on her own in Indonesia especially apt to attract unwelcome sexual advances?</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">63 If a matter is not mentioned in a Tribunal's findings, this entitles a court to infer that the matter was not considered by the Tribunal to be material ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) at [69]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">That the Tribunal Member engaged in no discussion of questions of those kinds suggests that the psychological aspects of the practical realities facing the appellant were not present to his mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">Given the strangeness of such matters not having been mentioned if they were considered, in my view it is appropriate to draw the inference that they were not considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">I do not wish to seem overcritical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The appellant's case was not a simple one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">She had, according to the Tribunal, embroidered some facts and the Tribunal Member thought that a friend who gave evidence was suggesting that, even in the Australian context, she was less robust a person than the Tribunal considered her to be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Nevertheless, it is notorious that in the last 20 years or so the high potential for sexual assault, let alone repeated instances of it, to cause the victim serious psychological difficulties, has become widely accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">I think that the kinds of potential difficulties to which I have referred were overlooked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">There has in my opinion been, as in NAIZ , a failure by the Tribunal to ask itself (as Branson J put it) 'the right questions'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">64 It follows that there has been, on that account, given also the failure to consider fully the aspect of persecution by a non-State agent in which the State authorities at local level might, for Convention reasons, have been sufficiently legally implicated, a constructive failure of jurisdiction of a kind sufficient to invalidate the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Leave to raise new grounds 
 
65 Thus, in my opinion, some of the new legal arguments have merit and some have not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">They involve legal questions only and there is no possibility that they might have been countered in the Federal Magistrates Court by the calling of evidence by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">There is no acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below except that these cases are difficult and it is not uncommon for different minds to perceive different legal problems and arguments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">There has been little dislocation to judicial sitting time though some in relation to judgment-writing time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The case raises no new legal issues of wider importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">66 The appellant has, it has been twice found by the Tribunal, suffered grievously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Should she be wrongly returned to Indonesia to face the risk of further persecution, it would be a bad affair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">There is no clear pattern of acceptance by successive Ministers of humanitarian concerns expressed by judges in reconsideration under s 417 of the cases of persons whose applications have been rejected by the Tribunal and who have been shown to have no available curial remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">I am not, of course, critical of the relevant Ministers in that regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Nevertheless, I cannot assume that there is likely to be any acceptance of obvious humanitarian concerns for the appellant, if she is not permitted to rely on those of her intended new grounds that have merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">In short, much is at stake for her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">67 Apart from questions of costs, which can be adjusted (and I have no reason to think appropriate orders would be simply hollow), there is no actual prejudice to the Minister, except a degree of disruption to orderly administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">That degree is not, however, great.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">68 It does concern me that the appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court might as well have not occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">The time and energy of a busy member of that court was wasted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">It is inescapable that the integrity of the proper curial processes is, to an extent, dealt a blow if the appeal to this Court is upheld on grounds that could have been argued below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">69 Nevertheless, I think that, on terms as to costs, in the interests of justice leave to raise the new grounds should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">The general desirability that an applicant for refugee status should have her case determined according to law has added force here, on account of what the Tribunal found she has suffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Disposition 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Leave will be granted to amend the Notice of Appeal to rely on the grounds discussed at paragraphs 29-64 of these reasons and the Notice of Appeal will be deemed to stand to amended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">The orders of the Federal Magistrates Court except as to costs will be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">The decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal will be quashed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">The Tribunal will be ordered to reconsider the appellant's application according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">The first respondent will be ordered to pay only $3,000 by way of the costs of the proceedings in this Court (such sum being a figure commonly allowed as the costs of an application to the Federal Magistrates Court).</sentence>

 BACKGROUND 
 The Background Application 
 
1 This is an application for the issue of the constitutional writs of certiorari and prohibition together with an injunction, pursuant to section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and section 475A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") concerning a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("R R T") made on 9 June 2004 affirming a decision of the delegate of the Respondent not to grant the Applicant a Protection (Class XA) Visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Consistent with the decision of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162, I propose to make an order joining the R R T as the Second Respondent in the proceedings although for the purposes of these Reasons I will describe the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs as the Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The essential contention in this application is that the R R T fell into jurisdictional error by failing to conduct a review of the Respondent's decision and therefore failed to exercise the statutory jurisdiction since the Tribunal failed to properly consider whether the Applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations pursuant to section 36(2) of the Act as a refugee consistent with Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , 189 UNTS 150 and the 1967 New York Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees 606 UNTS 267 (and thus a person entitled to a protection visa pursuant to section 65 of the Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The failure to properly consider whether the Applicant is such a person is said to arise because the Tribunal failed to consider all elements of the Convention definition of "refugee" for the purposes of the Act , applied an adverse finding on credibility to a determination of all relevant factual questions, improperly relied upon apparent inconsistencies between the evidence of the Applicant and a Mr (Pastor) George Ddungu, failed to provide the Applicant with adequate particulars of the evidence of Mr Ddungu the Tribunal considered would form part of the reason for affirming the decision of the Delegate of the Respondent, failed to properly consider evidence establishing a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason (assuming findings on the question of credibility properly excluded particular evidence) and failed to have regard to relevant evidence which would have been decisive in the determination of the application in the Applicant's favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 The findings of the R R T on the question of the credibility of the Applicant and whether reliance could be placed upon any evidence of the Applicant, was a central matter to the claim that the R R T had failed to properly exercise the statutory jurisdiction of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The Background Facts 
 
4 The background facts put to the R R T in a statutory declaration from the Applicant dated 1 July 2003 in support of the review, are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">5 The Applicant is a Ugandan national from the Muganda tribe in central Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The Applicant was born on 25 December 1978.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Prior to departing Uganda for Australia in October 2002, the Applicant was the Assistant Pastor to the Christ Alive Church in Uganda and the full time coordinator of a project called Earthlife Uganda and a further project called the Progressive Farmers Club (a project designed to assist the poor to become involved in various income generating activities).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">6 The Applicant's father was killed when the Applicant was quite young.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Applicant's father had become involved in the activities of the Democratic Party opposed to the Government of President Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress Party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Applicant also became a member of the Democratic Party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Some years ago (approximately early 2000) a referendum occurred in Uganda to determine whether Uganda should adopt a party system called the "Movement System" proposed by President Museveni or whether Uganda should retain a multi-party pluralist electoral system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Applicant opposed the adoption of the Movement System and campaigned both generally and through the Church against that system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">As a result, the Applicant contends that he was harassed and beaten by "military men" who supported President Museveni and particularly a group described as the Kalangala Action Group led by Major Kakooza Mutaale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">7 Prior to the presidential elections on 12 March 2001, the Applicant became very politically active and outspoken against President Museveni in support of a presidential candidate, Mr Kizza Besigye.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Besigye contended that the government had become corrupt and characterised by cronyism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Besigye lost the presidential election and fled Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Applicant says he was actively involved in many rallies and campaigns which criticised President Museveni, travelled to numerous villages campaigning for Besigye and criticised President Museveni to the congregation attending the Applicant's Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 Immediately prior to the election (about five days) military men detained the Applicant at his workplace and questioned him about his opposition and two days before the election Major Kakooza Mutaale came to the Applicant's Earthlife workplace with soldiers, accused the Applicant of campaigning against the Government through the Church, arrested him, tortured and beat him and threatened to kill him unless he stopped criticising President Museveni.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The Applicant was released about 10 hours later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">9 The day before the election, military soldiers came to the Applicant's workplace and instructed him to convince children and other young men and women to support President Museveni.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Applicant refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">During one rally, children and young men and women were taken by military men, beaten and subjected to physical injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">10 After the 2001 election and President Museveni's success, Besigye supporters were frequently harassed, detained and often killed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">On several occasions, the Applicant was threatened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">On one occasion, the Applicant was detained for a day, interrogated about aspects of the activities of a group called the Allied Defence Force ("ADF") rebels fighting the Government and questioned about the Applicant's support for same sex relationships through various Church projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Applicant says he was further detained because of his support for Besigye, intimidated and went into hiding for three weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">11 In early June 2002, a man named Mugerwa Charles came to the Applicant's orphanage in difficult personal circumstances and stayed for approximately two weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">His three children, Ssewankambo, Judith and Oliver Charles were already living at the orphanage due to the circumstances confronting their father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Mugerwa Charles then left the orphanage to re-join his wife who had acquired a house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Later that month, Mugerwa Charles was arrested by military officials and brutally tortured and killed by the group led by Major Kakooza Mutaale because Mugerwa Charles was perceived to be a strong supporter of Besigye and had attended anti-government rallies with the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Mugerwa Charles may also have been an ADF rebel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">12 The Applicant conducted the funeral service for Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">After the funeral a group of five men in civilian clothes with guns came to the Applicant's office and said they wanted to take the three children of Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Applicant refused to deliver up the children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The men said they would give the Applicant time to deliver up the children and would return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">They said that if the Applicant failed to deliver up the children he would be killed like Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">13 During 2001, another incident occurred which the Applicant recounted to the R R T "for the sake of completeness" (Documents Book, p.94, para 25), in these terms:
 
 "During 2001 I was involved in an outreach ministry in northern Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The LRA ("Lords Resistance Army") rebels captured me and my colleagues and told me that because I was a pastor they wanted me to give information to the President.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I thought that they would take us to the Sudan where their base is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">They released us, but they said that if we went back again they would get us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Since my assistant was killed in December 2002 I have thought more about this and now I feel afraid that the LRA rebels might come to central Uganda and capture me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">" 
 
 

14 In early July 2002, the Applicant travelled to Nairobi, Kenya to apply to the Australian High Commission for a visa to travel to Australia to talk to various people about sustainable development projects the Applicant was coordinating in Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The visa was granted on 5 July 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">On 28 May 2002, the Applicant had obtained a visa to travel to Germany to attend a development workshop related to particular project work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">However, the Applicant elected not to travel to Germany but travelled to Australia arriving on 4 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">15 In December 2002, the Applicant received a telephone call from Mr George Ddungu, the Administration Manager of the Earthlife Uganda Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Mr Ddungu told the Applicant that the men who had previously sought the three children of Mugerwa Charles had returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">On learning that the Applicant was not in Uganda, the men abducted the Applicant's assistant Ssenyonga Robert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Ssenyonga Robert has not been heard of since.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">These men (soldiers) told people in the Earthlife Uganda Project office that the Applicant had assisted a rebel (Mugerwa Charles) and must also be a rebel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">George Ddungu told the Applicant not to return to Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The Applicant made arrangements for the three children of Mugerwa Charles to be taken to Kenya.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">16 The Applicant says that he knows he will be killed if he returns to Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">If he had been at his workplace in December 2002, the Applicant believes he would have been taken and killed instead of Ssenyonga Robert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The Applicant says he would be killed because he helped Mugerwa Charles who the government soldiers believed to be a rebel and an "armed thief".</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The second reason why the Applicant believes he would be killed is his refusal to hand over the three children of Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The Applicant believes that he is perceived by these soldiers and particularly the group led by Major Kakooza Mutaale, the Kalangala Action Group, to be a threat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The Applicant says he believes these soldiers act with the approval of the government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Applicant further says that these men who he describes as the "President's men" do not like him because he has persistently campaigned against President Museveni, he is a member of the Muganda tribe (President Museveni discriminates against Muganda people in favour of his own tribe, the Banyonkole tribe) and he counsels and assists homosexual men and lesbian women through the Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">17 In the application form for the protection visa, the Applicant was asked to answer the question, "What do you fear may happen to you if you go back to that country?</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">" [Uganda].</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Applicant wrote an extensive response to the question which appears at pages 57 to 63 of the document bundle dated 26 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In that response, the Applicant recites elements of the factual material reflected in the written statement put to the R R T in the statutory declaration dated 1 July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">On the issue of the events that occurred in the northern part of Uganda around the town of Gulu, the Applicant said this (page 61):
 
 "On top of that with my Church we have [been] doing outreach ministry not only to peaceful areas, but also to areas in the north ie --- Gulu as God has called us to proclaim Christ to all societies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The Kony rebels abducted two of our youth evangelistic team and later returned the next day without any problems to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">They were not hurt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">They said that when they come back they will need the leader of the team to be taken so that he can talk to the Government for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Failure to comply with what they say will mean death to the leader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">I am the leader of the crusades of our Church for the outreach ministries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">" 
 
 

18 In a submission to the R R T dated 29 January 2004, the Applicant identifies his claims for protection based upon a Convention ground of persecution in these terms:
 
 
 (a) by reason of the Applicant's political opinion which is actual or imputed, arising from his assistance to and protection of alleged rebel, Mugerwa Charles and his refusal to hand over the children of Mugerwa Charles to persons believed to be working for President Museveni; and
 (b) by reason of the Applicant's membership of a particular group arising from his assistance to and protection of alleged rebel Mugerwa Charles and his refusal to hand over the children of Mugerwa Charles to persons believed to be working for President Museveni.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 

19 The Applicant is thus unwilling to avail himself of the protection of his country of nationality owing to a well-founded fear that he would be persecuted for each of the reasons identified in [18].</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
 
20 The Applicant arrived in Australia on 4 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">21 The Applicant initially applied for a tourism visa on 11 December 2001 for the purpose of visiting a sponsor in Australia and to undertake a study tour relevant to projects undertaken by the Applicant in Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The application was rejected on 20 December on the ground that the stated intention of only visiting Australia was not genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">A further application was lodged on 3 July 2002 with supporting sponsor documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">At that time, the Applicant identified a number of reasons which strongly suggested an intention and need on the part of the Applicant to return to Uganda at the conclusion of the three month visiting program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Those reasons included the observation that people served by the Applicant in the Progressive Farmers' Club project would need his continuing assistance, his mother was seriously handicapped and in need of support (and his sister and only sibling was living outside Uganda), he was committed to his project work associated with the Earthlife Uganda project, he had enduring obligations to take care of his family's farm and he was not tolerant of the cold winters in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">22 In these applications, the Applicant did not foreshadow any apprehension about the matters of concern which were subsequently reflected in the protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">23 On 14 January 2003, the Applicant lodged an application for a protection visa with the Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">On 4 February 2003, the Respondent's delegate refused the grant of a protection visa and on 6 March 2003 the Applicant applied for a review of that decision to the R R T. 
 
24 On 11 August 2003, the Applicant lodged the statutory declaration sworn 1 July 2003 reciting the background facts described at paragraphs [4] to [16].</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">On 22 December 2003, the R R T invited the Applicant to attend a hearing before the Tribunal to give oral evidence in support of the claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The hearing occurred on 19 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Prior to the hearing, the Applicant lodged a document apparently signed (and so certified by a solicitor) by Pastor George Ddungu on 7 January 2004 under the heading Christ Alive Church , in these terms:
 
 "We requested Pastor [the Applicant] to remain in Australia for fear of his life at the beginning of last year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">He had travelled on our Church's responsibility to meet a few persons out there and on behalf of the Church's activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 
 We assisted a poor person who was a member of this Church and later he was killed in a safe house by the government soldiers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">They later came to our Church office asking to take the orphans which [the Applicant] resisted saying he was a voice of the oppressed and they said they would come back to fulfil their mission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 
 As Pastor [the Applicant] was in Australia, the same men came back and they wanted to take him to the barracks but because he was not available they took our assistant Administrator Pastor James whom we do not know where he is up to now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">They claimed that the man we assisted was a rebel belonging to ADF rebel group who are based in southern Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">They also claimed that he had guns and was linked to the above group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Because of our association with him as a Church goer, they linked us to the above said group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 
 Secondly, because of Pastor [the Applicant] political history, it steered them up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">We pray that you will continue rendering the necessary assistance as we are convinced that his return may cost his life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">So our Church is now under organisations listed as supporting rebels and security organs claim that we are rebels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Generally speaking all pastors from this Church are being harassed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">
 
 We also pray that the soldiers stop these acts of plunder and ... killing innocent people in this country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">" 
 
 

25 On 29 January 2004 the Applicant's advisers made a submission to the R R T addressing the basis for the Applicant's claims, the evidence, the statutory tests and various United States State Department Reports on Human Rights Practices surveys.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In the course of the hearing on 19 February 2004, the Applicant recounted aspects of the factual background described previously and gave further evidence described by the R R T in this way:
 
 "In November 2001 he [the Applicant] decided to go to the North with food and medicines for children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">While on the way, the convoy was intercepted by LRA rebels and the applicant claimed to have been captured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">He was asked where he was taking food.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">He was asked to tell the Government to stop attacking the LRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">He was ordered to speak to Government officials by phone to deliver this message.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Eventually, he and his driver were able to escape and eventually made their way back to Masaka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Thereafter, he moved from place to place, at times pretending to be mad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 The applicant claimed, that as a result of this experience, he had been branded a rebel and a supporter of the LRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">He decided to leave the country, which he did with the assistance of George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">
 
 At the conclusion of the hearing, the applicant said that, now even the children in his projects wanted to kill him, because they say he was involved in rebel activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">" 
 
 

26 On 21 February 2004 (apparently received on 24 February), the Applicant wrote to the R R T advising that there were some points that he thought were important that he had forgotten to mention because he had a headache during the course of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">A six page typewritten commentary was sent with a handwritten covering letter to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">As to the capture by the LRA rebels and the forced telephone call to Government officials, the Applicant provided the following additional detail:
 
 "The rebels seemed as if they wanted to free us soon after my forced telephone talk, because they said that if we came back to the north they would get us and that because I went for prayer, if anything happens to them they would kill me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">They said that they have their informers also in the central part where I come from.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">They also said that they are also part of the Uganda People Defence Force (Army).</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The Ugandan Army is spread all over and so that also increased my fear and also to see that their informers are everywhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">After the telephone talk they wanted to take us to their base in southern Sudan to be trained and fight, but we managed to escape from them as they went to raid for food.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">" 
 
 

27 The second topic dealt with in the written submission dated 21 February 2004 concerned a letter dated 20 July 2003 written by LRA rebels and a further letter dated 27 January 2004 written by the rebels, delivered to either the Church or one of the project offices where the Applicant previously worked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">George Ddungu recounted the content of the letters to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The Applicant described them in this way: "The rebels dropped a letter saying that they need my head with the help of their informers in Kampala and Masaka where I live they will be able to get me; they dropped a similar letter on 27 January 2004 [saying] that they had not forgotten me that they will still pursue me and cut my head off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">They also wrote in this letter that I escaped from them and so they want to teach me how to obedient to them a little bit more by cutting my head off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">" 
 
28 On the question of the dominating influence of the LRA rebels (and the capture of the Applicant by the rebels) in the Applicant's fear of persecution, the Applicant made these further observations:
 
 "Kony rebels targeted religious leaders and charity organisations (aid workers) to which as a pastor of Christ Alive [I] fully belong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">
 
 I cannot get protection from the Government as they said [I] am a rebel because they failed to understand that [I] am not part of the LRA rebels regarding the forced telephone conversation, they have even continued to pursue me and even I do not know whether I will be settled again ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">I cannot relocate to anywhere because in the north the rebels need me, in the central the rebels have their informers and Government is also there ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">I thought of seeking asylum to Kenya, but I could not because it was very bad also, I could not even walk on the streets when I was there ... plus the Kenya Government sends back the asylum seekers to Uganda and they are killed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">I also wanted Mugerwa's children to be taken to a different country, but it did not happen, consequently their killing by the same Government soldiers that were pursing them and killed their Dad, this has been confirmed in the telephone talk by Pastor George.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">" 
 
 

29 The third matter dealt with in the submission concerned aspects of the Presidential election in 2001 and particularly the conduct of supporters of President Museveni and as an illustration of continuing arbitrary arrest and killing in safe houses the Applicant stated: "In addition to Mugerwa Charles, Pastor James and the three children, I can name many more people killed in safe houses, because of being part of the reform agenda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">When Pastor James was taken they were still pursuing me and also at the time of the death of the children even until now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Many of my friends and associates have either been killed or arbitrarily arrested because of their open support for the opposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">I was also tortured, arbitrarily arrested and put into detention into an army barracks a few times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">" 
 
30 The Applicant returned to the issue of his capture by the LRA on page 5 of the submission and said, "The Government failed to understand when I went and got abducted by the LRA rebels in the north.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">They have said that [I] am part of the rebels" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">31 On 26 February, the Tribunal made telephone contact with George Ddungu in Uganda to enquire about aspects of the circumstances confronting the Applicant in Uganda and the challenges confronting the Christ Alive Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The Tribunal member's note of that discussion with Mr Ddungu is contained at page 17 of the supplementary bundle of relevant documents dated 26 September 2005 and is in these terms: 
 
 "Note for file N03/47963 
 
 Conversation with Mr George Ddungu 
 
 The applicant had submitted two documents purporting to be faxes received from Mr. George Ddungu, his former supervisor in the Christ Alive church in Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">He also had made several references --- both oral and in writing --- to telephone conversations with Mr Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">I therefore decided to telephone Mr Ddungu at the phone number on the documents submitted by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The call was made in the evening of 26 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The number I called was 256-75-690099.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">I asked to speak to George Ddungu and the person who answered the phone identified himself as Mr. Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">
 
 I explained who I was and said that I wanted to talk with him about the applicant's situation in Uganda and the situation of his church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">I took notes of the conversation as it occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">
 
 The following is a summary of the main points of the conversation: 
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The only problem the applicant has is because of his activities in the north of Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">In 2001, the applicant travelled to the north of Uganda twice a month, because he was in charge of the church's northern programs and made monthly reports on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The children who died in Kenya died of a disease which was prevalent in the camp in which they were living.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The church has contacted the Uganda Human Rights Commission about its situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">
 
 
 
 
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The church was tipped off by immigration authorities that the applicant should leave the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">
 
 
 
 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The church's programs in the north continue and the church is in contact with other churches, including the Catholic Church, regarding its programs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">
 
 
 
 
 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The church's orphanages are in Masaka and in Kampala.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Most of the children are in Kampala.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">
 
 
 
 
 
 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The security people want the applicant to make a statement about the programs in the north.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">But one cannot discriminate --- one cannot know if a child is the child of a rebel if it needs shelter or has HIV/aids.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">
 
 
 
 
 
 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Security people came to the Kampala office, but Mr. Ddungu told them that the church had written to the Human Rights Commission and had contacted a lawyer, so they went away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">
 
 
 
 
 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">He could not go to Kampala office and was in a temporary office the church had in Masaka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">
 
 
 
 
 
 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The applicant could not survive in Uganda --- it was even necessary to bribe people at the airport because he was on a wanted list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">
 
 
 
 27 February 2004" 
 
 

32 On 27 February 2004, the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant in order to provide certain information arising out of the discussion with Mr Ddungu for the purposes of section 424A of the Act .</sentence>

 ..........................." 
 

33 On 11 March 2004, the Applicant responded to the letter of 27 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">In response to the six matters, the Applicant said this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">On 6 January 2001, the Applicant became chairman of the "Evangelistic Committee" of the Church which compelled the Applicant to travel to northern Uganda and particularly the districts of Gulu (in the north), Lira (in central to northern Uganda), Apach (northern district), Moyo and Kitgum (in the north).</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">People had fled particularly from Gulu and Lira to the Apach district due to the activity of LRA rebels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The Applicant visited Gulu reserve camps characterised by high death rates of children from hunger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The Applicant felt a pastoral obligation to be with children sleeping on the streets apparently in fear of being captured by LRA rebels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The Applicant conducted, with others, Church services to help raise finance to make travel to northern Uganda and particularly Gulu possible to address the problems in the north.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The Applicant repeated that during travel to the north he "was abducted by LRA rebels and forced to talk to the Government officials on the phone" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">34 On the issue of the abduction and escape of the Applicant, the further following remarks were put to the Tribunal:
 
 "My main problem is as a result of my abduction by the LRA rebels and my forced telephone conversation to the Uganda government officials on the 21 st November 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Which led to the government failure to understand that [I] am not an LRA rebel and thus their pursue of me as a rebel even until now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">At the same time our release by the main boy who was the main guard after he was overpowered by my colleague by saying 'Go' in his northern language (during which time the others had gone to raid for food) marked our release when the boys said 'go' and thus our escape from all the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Thus the LRA rebels need me because they said I prayed and cursed them and because I also escaped from them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">" 
 
 

35 The Applicant further described the letters of 20 July 2003 and 27 January 2004, claimed that George Ddungu could not talk to the Applicant on the telephone nor send faxes because of Government spies, discussed the conduct of Kony rebels, the perception of the Government that the Applicant is a rebel arising out of the forced telephone conversation, the difficulty presented by central LRA rebels and their informers and the difficulty of seeking asylum in Kenya because of the conditions prevailing in Kenya and the practice of the Kenyan Government of sending asylum seekers back to Uganda where such returnees are killed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">As to the three children of Mugerwa Charles, the Applicant said, "I also wanted Mugerwa's children to be taken to a different country, but it did not happen, consequently their death of which [I] am far beyond sure that they were killed by the same security personnel who were pursuing them and killed their Dad" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">36 The Applicant sums up his response to the reference by George Ddungu to the Applicant's "only problem" being his activities in the north of Uganda, as a reference to the Applicant's trip to Gulu, his abduction by LRA rebels, his forced telephone discussion with Government officials, the resultant perception on the part of the Government that the Applicant is an LRA rebel and the lack of protection that will be afforded to him by the Government of Uganda for that reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">37 The Tribunal reviewed the applications of 11 December 2001 and 3 July 2002 for a tourism visa by the Applicant and the notes of interview between the Applicant and a staff member of the High Commission of Australia in Nairobi in July 2002 concerning the Applicant's proposed trip to Germany on the night of that interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">On 12 March 2004, the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant putting particular information to the Applicant for the purposes of section 424A of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The letter is in these terms:
 " Australian Government

 Your Application for Review 
 
 The Tribunal has information that would, subject to any comments you make, be the reason, or part of the reason, for deciding that you are not entitled to a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">
 
 The information is as follows: 
 
 In the course of your hearing on 19 February and subsequently in written communications from your adviser, you claimed that you were abducted by the LRA on or about 21 November 2001 and obliged to make a compromising phone call to Government officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">You told the Tribunal that, on return to Masaka, you went into hiding for three weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">
 
 However, your visa application submitted by you in Nairobi on 11 December 2001 had attached to it supporting documents from the Bukoto Catholic Parish dated 26 November 2001, from the Butego Progressive Farmers Club dated 12 November 2001 and from the Progressive Institute of Business Studies Ltd dated 29 November 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The last of these states that you were a student, pursuing a two-years course leading to a Diploma in Tourism and that you were 'hard working, co-operative and willing to learn'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">
 
 You collected your passport with your visa for Australia in Nairobi on 5 July 2001 [this date ought to have been 5 July 2002] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">In an interview with the Australian High Commission, at that time, you said that you had to return to Uganda because you had a sick mother and that her only other child, your sister, was living in the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">You stated that you were going to a workshop in Germany that night.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">You stated that your Australian sponsors had taken over your education when your father died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Papers attached to your visa application indicated that the sponsorship started when you were twelve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">
 
 This information is relevant because: 
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The documents indicate that you may not have been where you claimed to be or doing what you claimed to have been doing in northern Uganda on the dates on which you claimed to be doing them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">You left Uganda and returned at least twice between December 2001 and your departure for Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">None of the documents submitted when you sought your visa for Australia nor your statements in interviews with the Australian High Commission made any reference to responsibility for church work in or visits to northern Uganda or involvement with an orphanage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">You appear to have been a full-time student of the Progressive Institute of Business Studies Ltd. 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Although you received your visa in July 2001 [this date ought to have been July 2002] , you returned to Uganda and did not leave for Australia until October, raising doubts about your claim to have at that time feared persecution.</sentence>

38 On 30 March 2004, the Applicant responded to the letter of 12 March.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">On the question of whether the Applicant was genuinely in northern Uganda in November 2001 having regard to the apparent inconsistencies arising out of the documents described in the letter of 12 March 2004, the Applicant said this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">The Applicant was in northern Uganda in November 2001 and was abducted by LRA rebels on 21 November 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The Applicant then went into hiding in a particular home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The Applicant's assistant, Robert, collected the Australian visa forms from the Canadian Consular Office and the documents attached to the visa application including the support letters from the Progressive Farmers' Club project, the Butego project and the Bukoto Catholic Parish Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Robert also collected a support letter from the Progressive Institute of Business Studies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">All these documents were taken to the Applicant in hiding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">They were filled out by the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Robert then sent them by registered mail to the Australian High Commission in Nairobi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The Applicant denied that he had travelled away from his hiding place at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">39 As to the failure to mention in the visa application any reference to responsibility on the part of the Applicant for Church work or Church visits to northern Uganda or involvement with an orphanage, the Applicant said this: "we decided that we do not mention much about my work and my employment commitments ie Earthlife, Christ Alive and my involvement in the north as this would lead into my mentioning my abduction by the LRA and my forced telephone conversation by the LRA to the Government officials that right now has put me in a state of conflicting loyalty about my continued living.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">This alone would lead the Australian High Commission to know about my fear and thus learning that I was going to seek asylum in Australia hence their rejection of the visa" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">40 Unfortunately, the letter of 12 March 2004 from the R R T incorrectly makes a reference to the collection by the Applicant of a visa for Australia on 5 July 2001 rather than 5 July 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">This caused the Applicant to extensively respond to the impossibility of collecting a visa in July 2001 which was applied for in December 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">41 The Applicant rebuts the notion that he left Uganda in periods between December 2001 and his date of departure for Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The Applicant returns to the matter of electing not to disclose to the Australian High Commission aspects of his involvement in Church work as that would necessarily involve disclosure of the contended abduction by LRA rebels in northern Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">For the same reason, the Applicant did not mention any aspects of his role at the orphanage or the problems concerning Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The Applicant asserts that he remained in hiding, was fearful for his life and anxious that he may not be able to leave Uganda for Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The Applicant described his arrangements with his Australian sponsors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">In relation to his German hosts or sponsors (the subject of the proposed visit to Germany based on a visa of 2 June 2002 disclosed to the Australian High Commission as background to the application for the 5 July 2002 Australian visa), the Applicant said this: "About the workshop, that I had to attend at that night in Germany, after informing my hosts in Germany that I wanted also to seek asylum there when I go, they informed me that they were to meet me in Uganda instead and thus my not travelling to Germany that particular night" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">42 On 12 May 2004, the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant in the following terms:
 "Australian Government 
 Refugee Review Tribunal 
 
 [The Applicant]
 
 12 May 2004 
 
 Dear [the Applicant]
 
 Your Application for Review 
 
 The Member reviewing your case has asked me to advise you as follows: 
 
 I have carefully reviewed all the claims and evidence before me and find I have a number of difficulties with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">
 
 In relation to the points put to the applicant post-hearing, I accept that the applicant did not travel to Nairobi in mid-December 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">However, the letter from the Progressive Institute of Business is dated in the middle of the period in which the applicant claims to have been in hiding and almost three weeks after his claimed trip to northern Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Irrespective of who collected the letters submitted with his visa application, it does not appear from the documents submitted that he was absent either from his studies or from his work in this period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">
 
 If one adds together the information supplied to the High Commission, which the applicant has not denied, the information supplied by the applicant in his primary and review applications and the information supplied by George Ddungu, which the applicant has also not denied, it would appear that, during 2001, the applicant travelled twice a month for his church to northern Uganda, started building a house, took care of a farm, took care of his blind and inform mother, was a valued employee of Earthlife Uganda and the Butego Progressive Farmers Association and was a conscientious student of tourism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">While I could accept that one person could do some of these things, I do not accept that one person could do them all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">
 
 However, my principal concern regarding the applicant's claims lies in the inconsistencies in his own evidence over time and the conflict with what I was told by George Ddungu, his former colleague in Christ Alive Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">
 
 
 
 
 (a) In his primary application, the applicant claimed that the LRA had abducted two of his youth evangelistic team, but let them go later, saying that they would need the leader of the team, so he could talk to the Government for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Failure to comply would mean the death of the leader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">
 
 (b) In his primary application, the applicant stated that he was asked during the 2001 Presidential election campaign to preach on behalf of President Museveni.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">He stated that his answer was that he was a pastor who did not involve himself in politics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">
 
 (c) In the statutory declaration of 1 July 2003 accompanying his review application, he claimed that he and colleagues were captured, but were released and told that they would be killed if they returned to the north.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">There is no mention of colleagues being abducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">
 
 (d) In the same statutory declaration, he referred in detail to his involvement in the 2001 Presidential election campaign on behalf of Col. Besigye, the opposition candidate, to being detained, to going into hiding and to being beaten on a number of occasions --- to none of which he had referred in his primary application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">
 
 (e) At hearing, he claimed that he escaped from the LRA, but only after being obliged to talk by telephone on the LRA's behalf to Government officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">
 
 These claims are not consistent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">
 
 
 
 
 Moreover, George Ddungu made no reference to the applicant having been captured and stated that the Government interest in him was only because of the work of the Church in northern Uganda, for which the applicant was responsible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">This also contradicted the applicant's claims to have aroused the negative interest of security authorities because of his assistance to Mugerwa Charles and his children or because of his counselling of homosexuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Moreover, George Ddungu also stated that the Church's work in northern Uganda continued, in collaboration with other churches, which calls into question the claim that this work had caused Government authorities to harass the Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">He also contradicted the applicant's claim that no complaint had been made to the Uganda Human Rights Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Finally, he stated that the immigration authorities advice that the applicant should leave the country prompted his departure, contradicting the applicant's claim to have heard it at the airport on departure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">
 
 His own inconsistencies weigh heavily against the credibility of the applicant's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">George Ddungu, in his written evidence and in conversation with me, clearly wanted to support the applicant, even though his evidence was not entirely consistent with what the applicant had claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">However, I have some reservations about his own reliability, since I called him to the number shown on his correspondence for his Kampala office, whereas he told me he had moved to Masaka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">
 
 Regarding the applicant's explanation as to why he did not go to Germany, the letter from the High Commission initially rejecting his visa application stated that the High Commission did not believe that his expressed intention only to visit Australia was genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">He then went to considerable lengths to satisfy the High Commission as to the genuineness of his intention to return to Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">When he received his visa, he told the Australian High Commission that he was leaving for Germany that night.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">His claim as to why he did not go to Germany means, therefore, that, later on that same day, he called Germany from Nairobi and told his hosts that he would apply in Germany for asylum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">In view of his experience with the Australian authorities, I find it inconceivable that he would do such a thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">It is much more likely that the applicant obtained the German visa to bolster his claim for an Australian visa and that no trip to Germany was ever planned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">In view of all the above, I have great doubts about the credibility both of the applicant and of George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">
 
 You are invited to comment on this information.</sentence>

 Yours sincerely

 for District Registrar 
 
 ..." 
 
 

43 On 27 May 2004 (apparently received on 1 June 2004), the Applicant responded to this lengthy letter by making a submission set out at pages 48 to 55 of the Supplementary Bundle of Relevant Documents dated 26 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">The Tribunal extensively considered the submission, evaluated the responses contained within it and summarised its assessment of the response in this way ( Bundle of Relevant Documents , 26 October 2004, page 345): 
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The explanations given to the Australian High Commission were necessary as, if [the Australian High Commission] had found out about his intention to seek asylum, he would have been denied a visa; 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">His work in family commitments were made possible because he had employees assisting him to build his house, run his farm and look after his mother; 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">The youth workers were abducted but died later of Ebola disease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">However, these are not the reasons he was seeking protection, which was his 'fear to die due to my abduction by the LRA and my forced telephone conversation to the government officials by the LRA on the 21 st November 2001 and consequently the unending pursuit of me by both parties for which reason I am seeking protection'; 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Regarding the 2001 Presidential campaign, the Applicant repeated his claim to have campaigned for the opposition candidate, but did not address the fact that he had made no reference to this claim in his primary application; he repeated that the basis of his claim was as set out in para 3 immediately above; 
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Regarding the inconsistency between his primary claim, involving the claimed capture of two colleagues by the LRA and the statutory declaration accompanying his review application, in which this is not mentioned, the Applicant misunderstood the question as referring to the owners of the vehicle in which he was travelling when captured and did not address the inconsistency; however, he stated that their capture was not the reason why he was seeking protection, but, rather it was the reasons referred to in para 3 above; 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Regarding his failure to mention earlier his involvement in the presidential campaign and the consequential beatings, detention and being forced into hiding, he stated that he was not aware of how much detail was required when he made his primary application; 
 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Regarding the question of whether he was released by or escaped from the LRA, he made a new claim --- that the owner of the vehicle overpowered a boy guarding them, who then said that they should go; 
 
 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Regarding my telephone conversation with George Ddungu, he said that the telephone system was being monitored and that George Ddungu could not tell me as much as I required and that he and George Ddungu used a code to talk about their activities; he claimed that George Ddungu was living in disguise and repeated the essential elements of his claims; 
 
 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">The Applicant's reply did not address the inconsistency between the Applicant's claim to having been harassed because of his activities in the north of Uganda and the statements made to me by George Ddungu about the Church's ongoing work and contacts with other churches; he simply restated his claims as to certain events and restated his reason for seeking protection in terms similar to that set out in para 3 above; 
 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">The Applicant accepted that the Church had approached the Uganda Human Rights Commission, but claimed that 'not much help' had been forthcoming; the reason for seeking protection was restated as above; 
 
 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">The Applicant's reply addressed but did not explain the inconsistency between his evidence and that of George Ddungu regarding the timing of receipt of information regarding official intentions towards him; 
 
 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Regarding my doubts as to George Ddungu's credibility, because of his claim to have been in Masaka when I telephoned him in Kampala, the Applicant stated that 'George's location is his personal issue', claimed that he was in disguise for fear of being killed and that 'George's location is not the reason why I am seeking protection' which was as stated in para 3 above; 
 
 13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">Regarding the claimed intention to visit Germany, the Applicant re-asserted that this trip was planned and stated that he had had to tell his hosts of his plan to seek asylum because they were reading to him the program for his trip; he did not address my expressed scepticism that he would so such a thing on the day of his departure for Germany.</sentence>

 THE DECISION, FINDINGS AND REASONS FOR DECISION OF THE REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
 
44 The Tribunal reviewed the facts reflected at paras [4] to [16], the articulated basis for the claim for a well-founded fear of persecution identified at para [18], the chronology of events, documents and correspondence described at paras [21] to [43] and made the following findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">The evidence put before the Tribunal reflected a number of inconsistencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Those inconsistencies apparent to the R R T were put to the Applicant in the letters of 12 March 2004 and 12 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The responses contained in the submissions made by the Applicant on 30 March 2004 and 1 June 2004 failed to resolve, for the R R T, the apparent inconsistencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">45 Some of the "difficulties" confronting the R R T arising out of the failure by the Applicant to properly address apparent inconsistencies were described as "peripheral" to the Applicant's central claims and although the R R T was not satisfied that its concerns about those matters had been addressed, the R R T nevertheless disregarded those concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The matters peripheral to the central claims included such factual assertions as the volume of tasks the Applicant claimed to perform while travelling regularly to the north of the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The R R T also had reservations about the Applicant's claims of involvement in the 2001 presidential election campaign.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">46 The R R T observed that in the response of 1 June 2004, the Applicant made it plain that his application for protection is based principally on a well-founded fear arising out of his encounter with the LRA and the consequences of that encounter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">The R R T expressed its assessment of the evidence of the Applicant and the credibility of the Applicant in these terms:
 
 "I do not accept his explanation for the fact that he made no mention of having been abducted by the LRA in his primary application [that is, the application for the protection visa].</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">
 
 Such a critical event in his life, with all the consequences which he later claimed flowed from it, does not fall into the category of 'detail' which he claimed he was originally not aware that was required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">
 
 Accordingly, I do not accept that the events surrounding his claimed abduction occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">
 
 I do not accept that he was abducted or that he was obliged to telephone Government officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">
 
 It follows that I do not accept that, as a result, he was obliged to go into hiding on return to Kampala or Masaka or that he was harassed by Government officials as a result of his visit to the north and his contact with the LRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">
 
 The Applicant's explanation as to why he did not go to Germany lacks all credibility and further undermines the credibility of his claims in general.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">" 
 
 

47 As to the relevance of the Applicant's engagement with the Australian High Commission, the R R T said this:
 
 "He had gone, on his own admission, to considerable lengths to hide his true intentions from the Australian authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">The letter from the High Commission initially rejecting his visa application stated that the High Commission did not believe that his expressed intention only to visit Australia was genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">He then went to considerable lengths to satisfy the High Commission as to the genuineness of his intention to return to Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">He told the Australian High Commission that he was leaving for Germany that night.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">His response to the Tribunal's letter asks the Tribunal to accept, therefore, that, on that same day, he called Germany from Nairobi and told his hosts that he would apply in Germany for asylum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">
 
 In view of his experience with the Australian authorities, I find it inconceivable that he would do such a thing --- inevitably prompting the reaction that he claims he received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">
 
 I find that the Applicant obtained the German visa to bolster his previously rejected claims for an Australian visa and that no trip to Germany was ever planned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">" 
 
 

48 Having made an assessment of the truthfulness of the Applicant's evidence, the R R T made the following findings:
 
 "Because of my general problems with the Applicant's credibility, I am unable to accept his claim to have supported Mugerwa Charles and to have refused to hand over his children, a claim further undermined by his attempt to implicate his alleged persecutors in the deaths of the children, which George Ddungu ascribed to disease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">
 
 Similarly, I do not accept that he was being harassed by the authorities because he counselled gay and lesbian people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">
 
 In short, I find the Applicant's evidence as to his own circumstances completely unreliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">
 
 I do not accept that the Applicant was captured by the LRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">
 
 I do not accept that he is sought by official or unofficial agents of the Ugandan Government or of the LRA or is in any other way under threat from them for any reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">
 
 I do not accept that he is under any threat from the people who were dependent on the projects he used to run.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">
 
 I do not accept that his mother has been attacked by people looking for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">
 
 I do not accept that he had to bribe his way out of Uganda or to obtain a passport or that he was advised at the airport (or at any other time) not to return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">" 
 
 

49 Thus, the R R T concluded that the Applicant had not demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason and that, on the evidence, the R R T was not satisfied that the Applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations for the purposes of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees .</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">THE GROUNDS OF THE APPLICATION 
 
50 The grounds of the application are:
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">The applicant was denied procedural fairness in that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) on 26 February 2004, in the absence of the Applicant, the Tribunal heard evidence by telephone from one George Ddungu ("Mr Ddungu"); 
 
 (b) the Tribunal failed to address questions to Mr Ddungu on matters likely to be within his knowledge and relevant to the review; 
 
 (c) the Tribunal failed to give to the applicant any or any adequate record or transcript of the evidence of Mr Ddungu; 
 
 (d) the Tribunal failed to give to the Applicant any or any adequate particulars of the evidence of Mr Ddungu that the Tribunal considered would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the Decision of the Delegate; 
 
 (e) the Tribunal failed to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable or at all, that the Applicant understood why the evidence of Mr Ddungu, or a part of the evidence, was relevant to the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">The Tribunal purported to make the Decision of the Tribunal without jurisdiction because: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) it made an adverse finding against the applicant founded on what it said was his explanation for the fact that he made no mention of having been abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army ("LRA") in his application for the Visa whereas the applicant did mention having been abducted by the LRA in the application; 
 
 (b) it made adverse findings against the applicant founded on the erroneous adverse finding referred to in subparagraph (a); 
 
 (c) in the premises, the Tribunal failed to review the Decision of the Delegate in accordance with section 414 of the Migration Act or at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">There was no evidence, or any sufficient evidence, before the Tribunal to support findings that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the events surrounding the applicant's claim that he was abducted by the LRA did not occur; 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the applicant was not abducted by the LRA; 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the applicant was not obliged by the LRA to telephone Government officials; 
 
 (d) the applicant was not obliged to go into hiding on returning to Kampala or Masaka; 
 
 (e) the applicant was not harassed by Government officials as a result of his visit to the north of Uganda and his contact with the LRA; 
 
 (f) the applicant's explanation as to why he did not go to Germany lacks all credibility; 
 
 (g) the applicant obtained the German visa to "bolster" his previously rejected application for an Australian visa; 
 
 
 
 
 (h) the trip to Germany was never planned; 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the applicant did not support one Mugerwa Charles and did not refuse to hand over his children; 
 
 (j) the applicant was not harassed by the authorities because he counselled gay and lesbian people; 
 
 (k) the applicant's evidence as to his own circumstances is completely unreliable; 
 
 (l) the applicant is not sought by official or unofficial agents of the Uganda Government or the LRA and is not under threat from them for any reason; 
 
 (m) the applicant is not under threat from the people who were dependent on the projects he used to run; 
 
 (n) the applicant's mother has not been attacked by people looking for the applicant; 
 
 (o) the applicant did not have to bribe his way out of Uganda or to obtain a passport; 
 
 (p) the applicant was not advised at the airport (or at any other time) not to return to Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">In the circumstances, the Decision of the Tribunal was illogical and unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">" 
 
 
 
 THE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE 
 
51 On the hearing of the application, the Applicant sought leave to read two affidavits sworn by the Applicant on 13 May 2005 and 29 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">As to the affidavit of 29 June 2005, the Applicant exhibits 11 documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">The first six exhibited documents already form part of the record being the letter from the R R T to the Applicant dated 27 February 2004, the Applicant's submission to the R R T dated 11 March 2004, the R R T's letter to the Applicant dated 12 March 2004, the Applicant's response dated 30 March 2004, the R R T's letter to the Applicant dated 12 May 2004 and the Applicant's reply dated 27 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">The remaining exhibits (7 to 11) supported by paras 8 to 21 of the affidavit address the recollections of and circumstances surrounding the discussion between the Tribunal member and George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Exhibit 8, for example, is an affidavit by George Ddungu deposing to George Ddungu's recollection of the telephone conversation on 26 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Exhibit 10 is an unsworn typewritten affidavit by George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Exhibit 11 is a facsimile of a sworn version of exhibit 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Exhibit 9 is the handwritten notes of George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">52 The Respondent objects to the admission of the affidavit on two grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">First, to the extent that the affidavit seeks to put before the Court the documents marked as exhibits 1 to 6, the documents are already before the Court and the affidavit adds nothing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">As to paras 8 to 21 and exhibits 7 to 11, the Respondent says the affidavit ought not to be admitted because the evidence is irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">The facts deposed to and documents exhibited do not go to any ground forming part of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">The application does not involve any allegation of bias, bad faith or improper purpose on the part of the Tribunal member in conducting the conversation, noting the conversation or relying upon the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">The Applicant simply seeks to adduce evidence which demonstrates that minds might legitimately differ about the recollections of the content of the conversation notwithstanding that the Tribunal member's typewritten note of the discussion on 26 February 2004 was made contemporaneously on 27 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">53 In Waco v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; 131 FCR 511; Lee, Hill and Carr JJ found the Tribunal had failed to afford procedural fairness to the applicant for a Protection Visa by finding letters central to the applicant's claim (submitted after the conclusion of the hearing) were not genuine, without giving the applicant an opportunity to be heard on that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">On the question of the evidential burden, their Honours at [58] said: 
 
 "It will not be necessary for the party alleging unfairness to put before the court the evidence which he would have presented had there not been a miscarriage of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">It is sufficient in such a case that the party has not been afforded an opportunity to put his or her case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">Only where the case is one where it can be shown that the Appellant could not, even if given the opportunity to do so, affect the outcome would it be held that there was no denial of procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">If the possibility exists that the Appellant, if given the opportunity might be able to make submissions or call evidence which could affect the outcome, the Appellant will not fail merely because the Appellant has not proved that the submissions or evidence would affect the outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">" 
 
 

54 Although it is not necessary for a party to put on evidence of the content of a possible response, evidence of that response or the possibility of a response that might have revealed evidence affecting the outcome may be admissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">It is not admissible for the purpose of establishing a controversy of fact or merits as to whether the Tribunal member said something or failed to properly record or appreciate something said by George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">In this case, the Tribunal put its concerns about a conversation with George Ddungu to the Applicant on 27 February 2004 and made reference to apparent inconsistencies arising out of the discussion with George Ddungu in the R R T's letter to the Applicant on 12 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">The Applicant had an opportunity to put information concerning a possible contradictory version of the conversation to the R R T from 27 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Moreover, the affidavit is not relevant to a ground of challenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">The particular ground of challenge going to the conversation with George Ddungu asserts a denial of procedural fairness arising out of a failure by the R R T to put all aspects of the conversation recorded by the Tribunal member to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">55 The proposition is that had all elements of the conversation been put to the Applicant, the Applicant might have said something further in response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">The question is whether there was a failure to afford procedural fairness in not putting all the elements of the conversation as noted by the Tribunal, to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">If the purpose of the affidavit is to contradict the Tribunal member's version of the conversation reflected in the typewritten note of 27 February 2004, no doubt the Respondent would seek to address the contention with evidence from the Tribunal member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">However, paragraphs 8 to 21 and exhibits 7 to 11 of the affidavit of the Applicant sworn 29 June 2005 will be admitted into evidence solely on the basis that the facts deposed to and the documents exhibited reflect things which might have been said or put to the R R T had points 7 to 11 of the conversation [31] in the note dated 27 February been put to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">56 The affidavit of 13 May 2005, deals with attempts by the Applicant to obtain the Tribunal member's handwritten notes of the conversation with George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Perhaps it is thought the handwritten notes will be inconsistent with the typewritten note of 27 February 2004 [31] or that propositions put to the Applicant in the letter of 27 February 2004 [32] were not a fair representation of what was actually said by George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Evidence directed to attempts to secure a handwritten note of the conversation which took place on 26 February 2004 are not relevant to the question of whether the Applicant was denied procedural fairness by reason of: 
 
 &#8226; points 7 to 11 in the note of the conversation not being put to the Applicant; 
 &#8226; the Applicant not being present when the conversation took place;
 &#8226; the Tribunal member failing to ask the correct questions; or
 &#8226; the Tribunal member failing to ensure the Applicant understood the evidence of George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">

57 The question of whether procedural fairness was denied the Applicant is to be determined by considering what was put to the Applicant arising out of the conversation as the material matters influencing the decision of the Tribunal in the context of the assessment of the evidence of the Applicant overall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Accordingly, leave is refused to read the affidavit sworn by the Applicant on 13 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">THE RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUES 
 The Process of Reasoning 
 
58 Although ground 1 of the application relied upon a denial of procedural fairness, the primary emphasis of the Applicant in oral and written submissions was directed to contended flaws in the process of reasoning adopted by the R R T. Accordingly, the first question is whether the R R T fell into jurisdictional error by failing to conduct a review of the Respondent's decision and by failing to exercise the statutory jurisdiction, by asking the wrong question or applying an unsound process of reasoning to the determination of whether the Applicant was a person to whom Australia had protection obligations under the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">The Applicant says the R R T properly considered the first element of whether the Applicant is a Ugandan citizen but failed to consider three other elements of the Convention definition of a refugee, namely, that the Applicant:
 
 
 (a) must fear persecution involving serious harm having an official quality in the sense of being official, or officially tolerated or officially uncontrollable by reason of a Convention attribute of the persecuted person
 (b) must fear persecution for a Convention reason of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or for reasons of political opinion; and
 (c) such fear of persecution must be well-founded upon a "real chance" which is not remote or insubstantial or far-fetched even though the possibility of persecution occurring is well below 50%,
 and determine whether those elements were satisfied or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">
 

59 The Applicant says the R R T adopted an unsound process of reasoning by conducting an assessment of the truth of the statements and evidence put by the Applicant to the R R T, then making adverse findings on credibility and then applying those findings to reject the Applicant's evidence and thus find a lack of satisfaction of a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Rather, the R R T ought to have addressed each element of the Convention (and therefore the statutory) criteria and made findings on all facts relevant to each element of the criteria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">60 In other words, the contention is that an examination of the reasoning of the R R T demonstrates that the Tribunal simply applied a reductive process of reasoning reducing all relevant questions to simply one of whether the Applicant could be believed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Thus, the R R T failed to exercise the statutory jurisdiction of review by failing to properly consider each element about which it was required to be satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">61 The argument is not borne out by a proper assessment of the reasoning of the R R T. 
 
62 The Tribunal in undertaking its analytical exercise, first framed the analysis by considering Australia's protection obligations to individuals within the scope of Article 1A(2) of the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">The Tribunal considered the precise elements of the definition and a number of important guiding opinions of the High Court of Australia in the construction and interpretation (and the Tribunal's obligations generally) of Article 1A(2) and important provisions of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">The Tribunal then identified four elements it described as key elements of the Convention definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">Those four key elements were identified as whether the Applicant was outside his country of nationality, whether the Applicant feared persecution involving serious harm, systematic and discriminatory conduct, a threat to life or liberty, significant physical harassment or ill treatment, significant economic hardship and other matters involving a consideration of section 91R(1)(b) and section 91R(2) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">The R R T noted that the High Court has explained that persecution may be directed against a person as an individual or as a member of a group and that persecution must have an official quality in the sense that it is official, or officially tolerated or uncontrollable by the authorities of the country of nationality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">The Tribunal further noted that the threat of harm need not be the product of government policy; it may be enough that the government has failed or is unable to protect the Applicant from persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">The R R T further noted that persecution implies an element of motivation on the part of those effecting the persecution and that individuals are persecuted for something perceived about them or attributed to them by their persecutors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">63 The R R T noted that the persecution which the Applicant fears must be for a Convention reason of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">The Tribunal noted that persecution feared by the Applicant need not be solely attributable to a Convention reason but a multiplicity of reasons will not satisfy the statutory test unless a Convention reason constitutes an essential and significant motivation for the persecution feared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">The R R T further noted that the Applicant's fear of persecution for a Convention reason must be a well-founded fear and explained that notion as one where the Applicant has a genuine fear founded upon a real chance of persecution where there is a real substantial basis for it but not if it is merely assumed or based on mere speculation .</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">The R R T observed that a 'real chance' is one that is not remote or insubstantial or a far-fetched possibility and a person can hold a well-founded fear of persecution even though the possibility of the persecution occurring is "well below 50%".</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">64 The Tribunal further noted that, additionally, the Applicant must be unable or unwilling because of his fear to avail himself of the protection of his country of nationality or be unwilling to return to his country of former habitual residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">65 Whilst it is true that decisions of the R R T often recite a preliminary analysis of these elements in common or similar form, the reasons do not suggest a formulaic application of the elements to the evidence or a failure to appreciate the scope or burden of the elements about which it had to be satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Rather, the Tribunal appreciated that section 36(2) recites as a criterion for a protection visa that the applicant for the visa must be a non-citizen in Australia to whom Australia had protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol .</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">The Tribunal recognised that it was required by section 414 of the Act to "review" the delegate's decision and section 415 conferred upon the R R T the power to exercise all the powers and discretions conferred by the Act upon the decision-maker and that the R R T stood in the shoes of the Minister for the purposes of section 65.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">That section requires the grant of a visa upon satisfaction of the relevant matters and notably the criteria prescribed by the Act and Regulations (section 65(1)(a)(ii)) and the refusal of a visa if not so satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 at [37] Gummow and Hayne JJ observed:
 
 "The satisfaction of the criterion that the applicant is a non-citizen to whom Australia has the relevant protection obligations may include consideration of factual matters but the critical question is whether the determination was irrational, illogical and not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds [Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 at paras [37], [52], [173]; cf at [9] If the decision did display these defects, it will be no answer that the determination was reached in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">However, inadequacy of the material before the decision-maker concerning the attainment of that satisfaction is insufficient in itself to establish jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">" 
 
 

66 The question of whether the adequacy of material before a decision-maker is sufficient to make out the necessary satisfaction on the facts is something about which minds might legitimately differ and as His Honour the Chief Justice observed in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 at [5]:
 
 "To describe reasoning as illogical or unreasonable, or irrational, may merely be an emphatic way of expressing disagreement with it".</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">
 
 
 and at para [9]: 
 
 
 "[T]o describe as irrational a conclusion that a decision-maker is not satisfied of a matter of fact, or a state of affairs, because the decision-maker does not believe the person seeking to create the state of satisfaction, or to describe the process of reasoning leading to such a conclusion as illogical, on judicial review of an administrative decision, might mean no more than that, on the material before the decision-maker, the court would have reached the required state of satisfaction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">
 
 

67 Because the source of the challenge to the decision lies in the constitutional jurisprudence attending section 75(v) of the Constitution and section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), the Applicant must establish an error of law on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Such error may embrace a number of notions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at page 351 [82], McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed: 
 
 "'Jurisdictional error' can thus be seen to embrace a number of different kinds of error, the list of which, in the passage cited from Craig [Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179] is not exhaustive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Those different kinds of error may well overlap .</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">The circumstances of a particular case may permit more than one characterisation of the error identified, for example, as the decision-maker both asking the wrong question and ignoring relevant material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">What is important, however, is that identifying a wrong issue, asking a wrong question, ignoring relevant material or relying on irrelevant material in a way that affects the exercise of the power is to make an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Further, doing so results in the decision-maker exceeding the authority or powers given by the relevant statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">In other words, if an error of those types is made, the decision-maker did not have authority to make the decision that was made; he or she did not have jurisdiction to make it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">Nothing in the Act suggests that the Tribunal has given authority to authoritively determine questions of law or to make a decision otherwise that in accordance with the law".</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">
 
 

68 In this case, the Applicant contends that the R R T failed to ask itself any of the relevant questions other than whether the Applicant was a non-citizen, failed to afford procedural fairness in providing the Applicant with aspects of the conversation with George Ddungu, failed to reach the necessary level of satisfaction by making unsupported findings and reached a decision which was illogical and unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">69 The R R T correctly framed, expressly, the issues which it had to consider in undertaking its review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">The Tribunal elected to consider whether each of those elements were satisfied by embarking upon a detailed forensic assessment of each of the Applicant's claims and his evidence to determine whether it could be satisfied that the Applicant was, at the date of its decision, a person to whom Australia owed protection obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">In undertaking that forensic exercise, the R R T considered all of the background facts recited at [4] to [16].</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">It considered the material before the Respondent's delegate and the answers given by the Applicant to the questions in the protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">It considered the Applicant's submission of 29 January 2004 and the way in which the Applicant framed his claims for protection based upon a Convention ground [18].</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">The R R T considered the Applicant's statutory declaration sworn 1 July 2003 [24] and a document signed by George Ddungu on 7 January 2004 [24] speaking to aspects of the claims made by the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">Because the Applicant had placed great emphasis upon the notion of his capture by LRA rebels and demands made by those rebels, the Tribunal had regard to the question of whether there was consistency between answers given in the protection visa application and oral evidence and statements made about those matters in the course of the proceedings before the R R T. The Tribunal considered the oral evidence of the Applicant [25], the Applicant's clarifying document of 21 February 2004 [26], the observations about capture by the LRA rebels and the forced telephone call to government officials [26], letters written by the LRA rebels on 20 July 2003 and 27 January 2004 [27] and the Applicant's fear of persecution arising out of his capture by the LRA rebels and his forced engagement with government authorities [28], [30], [33], [34], [36] and [39].</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">70 It is clear from the process of reasoning that these matters were considered expressly in the context of an evaluation of the framework elements identified by the R R T [62] to [64].</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">71 The R R T considered the Applicant's claims about the conduct of supporters of President Museveni concerning indiscriminate killing of individuals perceived to be hostile to the government and particularly illustrative of that conduct, the killing of Mugerwa Charles and his three children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">The Tribunal then further considered the consequential fear on the part of the Applicant arising out of the government's failure to appreciate that the Applicant was not truly a member of the LRA rebel group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">72 The Tribunal then sought to elucidate aspects of the claims by speaking directly with [Pastor] George Ddungu [31].</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">That conversation [31] revealed 11 points going to aspects of the allegations or background facts concerning the Applicant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">The discussion with George Ddungu revealed, in the mind of the Tribunal member, a number of inconsistencies and on 27 February 2004 [32] the Tribunal put those matters it considered material to its determination to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">The function of that letter was to provide the Applicant with an opportunity to comment on six relevant matters which were perceived to be relevant to a decision on the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">The Tribunal [33] considered the Applicant's response, his claim of abduction by LRA rebels and forced engagement with government officials [33] and [34].</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">The R R T considered the Applicant's comments concerning the LRA letters of 20 July 2003 and 27 January 2004 and the reassertion of the killing of the three children of Mugerwa Charles [35].</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">73 The conversation by the Tribunal member with George Ddungu [31], the letter to the Applicant [32] and the assessment of the response [33], [34], [35] and [36] was directed to both resolving, in the mind of the Tribunal, apparent inconsistencies and whether the evidence satisfied the framework questions [62] to [64].</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">74 Further matters of inconsistency, in the mind of the Tribunal arose out of the R R T's consideration of aspects of the material put by the Applicant to the High Commission of Australia in applications made on 11 December 2001 and 3 July 2002 [37].</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Those matters went to apparent inconsistencies between the movements of the Applicant in the latter months of 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">These concerns were the subject of a further letter to the Applicant [37] providing the Applicant with an opportunity to clarify those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">75 The Tribunal considered the Applicant's response [38] and in the face of that response a lengthy letter was written to the Applicant [42] putting a series of concerns going to questions such as whether the Applicant was genuinely in hiding as he contended, whether the Applicant was engaged in the field of activities contended for, whether the Applicant was abducted by LRA rebels, whether the Applicant had such a level of engagement in the 2001 presidential elections that he would be perceived to be politically hostile to the government (particularly in conjunction with the forced engagement with government representatives by reason of his capture by LRA rebels) and other matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">76 The reasoning of the R R T suggests that these propositions were put to the Applicant to test the strength of the various contentions of the Applicant as he sought to plot the points on the continuum in establishing each of the framework elements formulated by the R R T. The reasoning suggests strongly that the R R T was not simply reducing its statutory task to one of whether the Applicant could be believed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">The question addressed by the R R T was whether the statutory elements were satisfied by reason of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">77 The Tribunal considered the Applicant's response of 27 May 2004 [43].</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">An assessment of that response reveals that the Tribunal's extensive consideration of the submission [43] is a fair and proper reflection of the response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">78 Having considered all of this evidence, the Tribunal noted that the Respondent principally based his application for protection upon a well-founded fear of persecution arising out of his encounter with the LRA rebels and the consequences of that encounter in terms of the perception the government (and the army) would hold of his political opinions either actual or imputed and its perception of his association with a group hostile to the government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">The forensic analysis of the evidence was designed to lead to a judgment about whether the R R T would be satisfied of such a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">The conclusions [46], [47] and [48] were clearly open to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Those conclusions reflect a thorough rejection of the evidence of the Applicant and his systemic claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">79 A part of that assessment involved a core claim by the Applicant concerning his abduction by the LRA rebels and an assessment of the inferences and conclusions to be drawn from a consideration of all of the Applicant's material and statements made in response to questions in the protection visa application form as compared with the Applicant's statutory declaration sworn 1 July 2003 [24], the Applicant's submission dated 29 January 2004 [25], the Applicant's oral evidence, the Applicant's letter to the R R T dated 21 February 2004 [26], [27], [28], [29] and [30], the Applicant's letter of 11 March 2004 [33], [34] and [35] and the Applicant's submission of 27 May 2004 [43].</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">The conclusions on those matters were open to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">80 In reaching those conclusions, the Tribunal provided the Applicant with an opportunity to make written submissions, provide oral evidence and respond to a specific and focused expression of concern about particular matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">In dealing with the evidence of the Applicant and reaching the conclusions reflected at [46], [47] and [48], the R R T was expressly dealing with the issues identified at [62], [63] and [64].</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">The process of reasoning was not simply a reductive assessment of the credibility of the Applicant but an assessment of whether the evidence established the statutory criteria in the way framed by the R R T which, in turn, necessarily involved an assessment of the truthfulness of the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">In the assessment of the evidence generally, the R R T's view of the credibility of the Applicant was, however, decisive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">The findings demonstrate that the R R T evaluated each of the claims and tested the version given by the Applicant in relation to his alleged abduction by LRA rebels, the consequences of the abduction, the events surrounding the abduction, the obligation to conduct a telephone discussion with government officials, his claim to go into hiding on return to Kampala or Masaka, the claimed harassment by government officials and the explanation as to why the Applicant ultimately did not go to Germany.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">The R R T expressed "general problems" with the Applicant's credibility, described the Applicant's evidence as "completely unreliable" and rejected the Applicant on the matters identified at [48].</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">81 Therefore, on the whole of the evidence, the R R T, for reasons given at length, found the Applicant's version of events completely unreliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">It may be that the Applicant's credibility had been so weakened that no weight redemptive of the poisoned well of credibility could be attributable to his evidence: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 at [49]; McHugh and Gummow JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">However, the R R T undertook a systemic examination of each of the elements about which it had to be satisfied for the purposes of sections 36(2) , 65 , 414 and 415 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">It was open to the R R T to make the findings reflected in the reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">The process of reasoning was sound and not affected by illogicality, unreasonableness or irrationality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">Based upon its assessment of the evidence, it was open to make the findings under challenge by grounds 2 and 3 of the application [50].</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">On the question of the process of reasoning leading to credibility findings, His Honour, Justice McHugh observed in Re The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at [67] :
 
 "In addition, the prosecutor alleges that the Tribunal breached s.430(1) by failing to set out reasons for its finding that the prosecutors claim that members of PLOTE tried to recruit him were 'utterly implausible'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">However, this was essentially a finding as to whether the prosecutor should be believed in his claim --- a finding on credibility which is the function of the primary decision-maker par excellence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">If the primary decision-maker has stated that he or she does not believe a particular witness, no detailed reasons need be given as to why that particular witness was not believed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">The Tribunal must give the reasons for its decisions, not the subset of reasons why it accepted or rejected individual pieces of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">In any event, the reason for the disbelief is apparent in this case from the use of the word 'implausible'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">The disbelief arose from the Tribunal's view that it was inherently unlikely that the events had occurred as alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">" 
 
 

82 The Applicant contends that the R R T fell into the error warned against by the High Court in the Court's reasons in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 and Abebe v Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">As to SGLB , the applicant says that the process of reasoning is one designed for arriving at the best possible understanding of the facts in an inherently imperfect environment and that the process is not one directed to punishing or disadvantaging vulnerable people because they have made false or inconsistent statements or are believed to have done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">As to Abebe , the applicant relies upon the observations of their Honours Gummow and Hayne JJ in observing that inquiring whether a person has a well-founded fear of persecution is attended by very great difficulties and that there is no warrant for the Tribunal adopting some unthinking application of rules of law to a person from a wholly different society coming to a new country in which that person seeks asylum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">83 As to the application of the principles reflected in SGLB , there is no basis for concluding from the reasons of the Tribunal that it sought to punish or disadvantage the Applicant as a vulnerable person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">The Tribunal gave no weight to the matter at [22].</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">The R R T sought to establish to its satisfaction on all the evidence whether the Applicant was a person to whom Australia owed protection obligations within the framework of the case put by the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">As to Abebe , there is no warrant for construing the reasons of the Tribunal as the formulaic unthinking application of procedural or legal rules derivative of an orthodox and stable democracy to a person from a wholly different society who would be likely to be conditioned by behavioural norms appropriate to an entirely different polity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">The R R T sought to forensically determine a basis upon which it either might or might not be satisfied as to the framework issues identified at [62] to [64].</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">84 The Applicant further contended that even if the forensic analysis of the evidence resulting in adverse credibility findings was properly undertaken, there were many other grounds for determining the application in favour of the Applicant which the Tribunal failed to address and upon which no findings were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">The Applicant exhibited a schedule identifying 42 factual contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">No finding was made by the Tribunal on 14 of those contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">As to 24 of these contentions, the Tribunal rejected the contention by disbelieving the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Some examples of factual contentions about which the Tribunal made no finding are these: supporters of President Museveni lobby youth and beat them; government not interested in Bawaga people; Applicant's father killed opposing President Milton Obote when the Applicant was a young boy; children beaten and legs broken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">85 In discharging the duty cast upon the Tribunal in undertaking a review of the decision, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to make a finding on each and every factual contention put to the R R T. The R R T must take the case put to it by the Applicant either articulated by the Applicant or identified upon a proper assessment of the material put to the R R T but not necessarily fully articulated or developed, inquire into the elements of the factual contentions to determine whether the Tribunal might reach the required state of satisfaction, address its statutory mind to the correct inquiry, correctly apply the rules of law including rules of procedural fairness and determine whether the Applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">In discharging that role, it is not necessary to decide each and every factual contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">The Applicant has not demonstrated any error of law on the part of the Tribunal in the treatment of the evidence and the contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">86 The Applicant further contends that the R R T failed to have regard to other important evidence, namely, the evidence of George Ddungu confirming that the Applicant was a church worker in Uganda and had experienced problems with the LRA rebels in the north of the country because of his activities with the church, evidence that should the Applicant return to Uganda he would be killed because of these activities and independent country information (200 pages) evidencing problems faced by church and charity workers in Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">87 As to these matters, the Tribunal expressly had regard to the historical work of the Applicant for the Christ Alive Church in Uganda and forensically examined the claims, work, movement and activity of the Applicant on behalf of the Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">The R R T had regard to the letter signed by George Ddungu on 7 January 2004 [24] and information concerning the activities of the Applicant in the north of Uganda on behalf of the Church [31] and the information provided by the Applicant [38].</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">The Tribunal tested all of these matters to determine whether it could reach the required level of satisfaction on the questions before it recognising that the emphasis in the claim made by the Applicant for a well-founded fear of persecution was persecution from government authorities by reason of a perception of political opinions he might hold hostile to the government and a perception of membership of the LRA rebel group by reason of his engagement with government as a function of his capture by the rebels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">His claim of a well-founded fear of persecution is not based upon his membership of the Christ Alive Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">The claim made in the submission dated 29 January 2004 [18] was based upon actual or imputed political opinion or, alternatively, a perception that the Applicant was a member of a particular group hostile to the government arising out of his association with Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">In any event, the R R T considered the totality of the evidence including the implications of the Applicant's role in the Church and reached a decision open on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">88 As to the independent country information, the R R T did not make findings about or comment upon the independent country information going to the scope of the problems faced by church and charity workers in Uganda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">This is no doubt because an examination of the independent country information does not demonstrate material going to the Applicant's participation within a particular group or the activities of members of a group described as that group comprising those who gave "assistance to and protection of alleged rebel Mugerwa Charles" and those who were involved in a refusal to hand over to the military or government authorities the children of Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">Further, although the independent country information describes the scope of the difficulties faced by charity organisations and church groups in Uganda, the information does not go to the issues put before the R R T as the basis for this Applicant's claim of a well held fear of persecution which relies upon a particular perception on the part of the government arising out of the contentious telephone discussion based upon the contentious capture allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">89 The Applicant further contends that the R R T misdirected itself by treating the information and evidence of George Ddungu with caution and that it was unreasonable for the Tribunal to question George Ddungu's credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">The R R T, in fact, relied upon information put to it by George Ddungu as the basis for testing some of the claims of the Applicant and although the R R T member felt George Ddungu was, in some senses quite naturally, supporting and extending himself in support for the Applicant, the Tribunal simply adopted a cautious approach based upon an apparent inconsistency in George Ddungu's statement concerning his move from Kampala to Masaka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">90 The Applicant further contends that the R R T misdirected itself as to aspects of the original application by describing aspects of the oral evidence as raising new claims when those claims had been raised in the original application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Those claims went to the question of the alleged capture of the Applicant by LRA rebels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">This event and aspects of it were seen by the Tribunal as new in the sense that they were not consistent with the matters raised by the Applicant in the visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">The point seems to be that in the application form the Applicant said that Kony rebels (LRA rebels) abducted two of the Church's youth evangelistic team and released them the next day unhurt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">The rebels apparently said that on the next occasion they would need the leader of the team so that the leader could speak to government officials for them, presumably because the rebels lacked the necessary education.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Subsequently, the Applicant said that he had been captured by rebels with his colleagues, thought he would be taken to Sudan and was subsequently released.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">He later said that he had been captured and was forced into engaging in telephone discussions with government authorities which gave rise to the perception that the Applicant was a participatory member of the LRA rebel group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">As indicated in these reasons [4] to [43] the R R T tested these matters in considerable detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">91 There is no demonstrated error on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">Denial of Procedural Fairness 
 
92 The second question is whether the Applicant was denied procedural fairness arising out of the matters related to the discussion between the Tribunal member and George Ddungu on 26 February 2004 [50].</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">In determining questions of fact on issues before it, the Tribunal was entitled to make an inquiry directly of George Ddungu and seek to put to George Ddungu questions which, in the view of the Tribunal, would be likely to inform its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">The content of the obligation of procedural fairness in the discharge of the statutory function does not require an applicant to be present when the R R T seeks information about a contention or seeks to inform itself about facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">The Act requires the R R T to put to the Applicant in the way that the R R T considers appropriate in all the circumstances, particulars of any information that the R R T considers would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">The Act also requires the R R T to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the Applicant understands why that information is relevant to the review undertaken and invite the Applicant to comment on the information (section 424A).</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">93 On 27 February 2004, the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant [32] and put six matters arising out of the conversation with George Ddungu [31] to him and invited him to comment on the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">The Tribunal expressly said that the six matters, subject to any comments by the Applicant, would be the reason or part of the reason for deciding that the Applicant was not entitled to a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">The R R T did not put every aspect of information gathered by the Tribunal as a result of the discussion with George Ddungu to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">The information reflected at points 7 to 11 [31] may have been contextual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">The Tribunal may have considered the information relevant or irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">If relevant, the Tribunal had a statutory obligation to have regard to the information although ultimately it may not have formed the reason or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">A consideration of the reasons and the conclusions demonstrate that the information noted at points 7 to 11 [31] did not form the reason or a part of the reason [46], [47] and [48] for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">94 Importantly, the Tribunal's duty and power to conduct the review is conditioned upon the Tribunal's observance of the requirements of procedural fairness as a matter of common law not just a question of construction of provisions of the Act : Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 615 per Brennan J; Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 40 per Brennan J; Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 --- 600 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ, 604-605 per Brennan J; Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 591 per Brennan J; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at 99-100 [38] --- [39] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ; Gleeson CJ at 89 [5], Kirby J at 131 [132] and Hayne J 142-143 at 168.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">A failure to provide procedural fairness is an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">Two aspects of procedural fairness require consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">The first is that in the ordinary case where no issue of confidentiality arises, an opportunity should be given to an applicant to deal with adverse information given to the Tribunal that is "credible, relevant and significant" ( Kioa v West ; Brennan J) to the decision to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">The second aspect involves a recognition that information of that kind is likely to create a risk of prejudice, perhaps subconscious, and it is unfair to deny a person whose interests are likely to be affected by the decision, an opportunity to deal with the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">95 A question then is whether the information noted at points 7 to 11 [31] of the Tribunal member's conversation with George Ddungu constituted adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">In Applicant Veal of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2005] HCA 72 (6 December 2005), [' Applicant Veal' ], Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ at [16] observed expressly as matters of general principle:
 
 "As is always the case, what is said in reasons for judgment must be understood in the context of the whole of the reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Examining sentences, or parts of sentences, in isolation from the context is apt to lead to error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">In particular, what Brennan J said about 'information that is credible, relevant and significant' takes its meaning from the point his Honour had made only a few sentences earlier [in his Honour's judgment in Kioa v West] that: '[a]dministrative decision-making is not to be clogged by inquiries into allegations to which the repository of the power would not give credence, or which are not relevant to his decision or which are of little significance to the decision which is to be made' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Moreover, what is meant by 'credible, relevant and significant' must be understood having regard also to the emphasis that his Honour had given earlier in his reasons to the fundamental point that principles of natural justice, or procedural fairness, 'are not concerned with the merits of a particular exercise of power but with the procedure involved that must be observed on its exercise'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">
 
 Because principles of procedural fairness focus upon procedures rather than outcomes , it is evident that they are principles that govern what a decision-maker must do in the course of deciding how the particular power given to the decision-maker is to be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">" 
 
 
 and at [17]:
 
 
 "It follows that what is 'credible, relevant and significant' information must be determined by a decision-maker before the final decision is reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">That determination will affect whether the decision-maker must give an opportunity to the person affected to deal with the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">And that is why Brennan J prefaced his statement about a person being given an opportunity to deal with adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant, by pointing out that there may be information, apparently adverse to the interests of a person, which can and should be put aside from consideration by the decision-maker as not credible, not relevant, or of little or no significance to the decision to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">'Credible, relevant and significant' must therefore be understood as referring to information that cannot be dismissed from further consideration by the decision-maker before making the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">And the decision-maker cannot dismiss information from further consideration unless the information is evidentially not credible, not relevant or of little or no significance to the decision that is to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">References to information that is 'credible, relevant and significant' are not to be understood as depending upon whatever characterisation of the information the decision-maker may later have chosen to apply to the information when expressing reasons for the decision that has been reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">", 
 
 
 and as to subconscious effect and the potential for prejudice at [19]:
 
 
 "As has rightly been said, 'the necessity to disclose such material in order to accord procedural fairness is not based on answering a causal question as to whether the material did in fact play a part in influencing the decision.</sentence>

<sentence id="s518">It follows that asking whether ... the Tribunal may have been subconsciously affected by the information distracts attention from the relevant inquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">The relevant inquiry is: what procedures should have been followed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">The relevant inquiry is neither what decision should the decision-maker have made, nor what reasons did the decision-maker give for the conclusions reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">" 
 
 

96 In Applicant Veal , the applicant and his partner applied for protection visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">The Minister's delegate refused the applications and each sought review by the R R T of that refusal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">After the applications had been made but before the R R T had completed its review, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs received an unsolicited but not anonymous letter making allegations against the male applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">The letter alleged the applicant admitted he had been accused of killing a person prominent in the political affairs of the applicant's country of origin (Eritrea) and that the applicant was a supporter of, and working for, the government of Eritera.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">The letter was communicated to the Department on a secret or confidential basis but then provided to the R R T. The R R T affirmed the decisions not to grant protection visas to the applicants and in giving its reasons said that it gave no weight to the letter sent to the Department and forwarded to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">The question was whether nevertheless, the applicant was denied procedural fairness by not being given an opportunity to respond to the letter and whether the letter had a subconscious effect upon the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">97 Their Honours concluded that the alleged admission by the applicant and whether the applicant was working for the government of his country of origin were matters that "bore upon whether he had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason": ( "Applicant Veal" ) [20] and that procedural fairness required the Tribunal to draw the appellant's attention to the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">Their Honours then dealt with important questions of analogical principle concerning "public interest immunity" not relevant in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">98 The Tribunal, in the discharge of its duty is bound to make its own inquiries and form its own views upon the claim made by the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">Information obtained by the Tribunal which is relevant to that inquiry cannot be ignored by the Tribunal nor can the information be put to one side before reaching a conclusion that the application should be refused, in circumstances where the information demonstrates facts and circumstances which would lead the R R T to the conclusion that it could not be satisfied that an applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">99 In this case, the Tribunal made inquiries and obtained information from George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">The information was not communicated anonymously nor was it given in any confidential circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">The reasons demonstrate that the first six points of the note of the discussion contained adverse information affecting the Applicant which was credible, relevant and significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">It was communicated to the Applicant so that he might be provided with an opportunity to deal with the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">Points 7 to 11 in the note [31] were not matters relevant to the decision of the Tribunal or were matters of little significance to the decision to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">The procedure adopted by the Tribunal was to put to the Applicant that body of information which the Tribunal regarded as credible, reliable, reflective of inconsistencies in other evidence of the Applicant (and therefore significant) so as to enable the Applicant to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">100 The Tribunal was not required to put points 7 to 11 of the information [31] obtained from George Ddungu to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">The Applicant's affidavit of 29 June 2005 (paras.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">8 to 21 and exhibits 7 to 11) has been admitted into evidence simply on the ground that the documents reflect those further things that might have been said or put to the R R T had points 7 to 11 been put to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">Since there was no obligation to put those points to the Applicant there was no denial of procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">In any event, the Applicant knew from approximately 27 February 2004 [32] that the Tribunal member's discussion with George Ddungu resulted in important information (points 1 to 6) being provided to the Tribunal, the information was regarded as important and significant and likely to form part of the reason for deciding the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">Whatever contention the Applicant may wish to have put to the R R T, he was able to put it from approximately 27 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">101 The R R T did not fail to afford procedural fairness to the Applicant by failing to address questions to George Ddungu on matters which may or may not have been within his knowledge or upon matters likely to be within his knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">The R R T was entitled to obtain any information from George Ddungu that it considered potentially relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">Nor did the R R T fail to afford procedural fairness by failing to provide the Applicant with a record or transcript of the information provided by George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">The Tribunal may gather information as it considers relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">Some of that information will be relevant and will be considered and evaluated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">Arising out of that consideration, information may form a part of the reason for affirming a decision in which event the R R T has a duty to put that information to the Applicant and invite comment upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">The content of the obligation to provide procedural fairness does not require an applicant be provided with "a transcript of the evidence" [50] gathered by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">In this case, there was no obligation upon the R R T to provide the Applicant with a transcript of the information provided to the R R T by George Ddungu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">A consideration of the letter dated 27 February 2004 [32] demonstrates that the R R T conveyed the information the Tribunal then considered would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review, to the Applicant in clear and precise terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">Plainly enough, the Applicant understood the content of the letter and responded comprehensively [33].</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">102 Accordingly, the application must be dismissed.</sentence>

 THE APPLICATION 
 
 1 This is an application in the original jurisdiction of the Court by way of an appeal under section 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act ") from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") by which the Tribunal determined that particular documents of the Applicant were not exempt on the contended ground of legal professional privilege, from access to the Respondent pursuant to Part III of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) ("the FOI Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">To avoid any confusion between the Applicant for the documents and the Applicant for relief in these proceedings, I will describe the Applicant in the proceedings as Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">I will describe the Respondent in the proceedings as Ms Foster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">THE BACKGROUND 
 
2 The background facts and relevant statutory provisions are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 Comcare is a body established by sections 68 and 74 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) ("the SRC Act ") and has the functions and powers conferred by sections 69 and 70 among other functions conferred by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">4 Ms Foster made claims upon Comcare for compensation in relation to incapacity and also permanent impairment on 31 March 1999 (Q1999/369) and 13 December 2002 (Q2002/1094) among other claims including an application in November 1994 (Q1994/731) all pursuant to the SRC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">5 On 23 January 2003, the Respondent made an application to Comcare for the provision of copies of documents relating to those claims in these terms:
 
 "I would like to request copies of all my files, computer, email, paper notes etc.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">I would have files in the department with your litigation area, AAT files, section 37 'T' documents, medical files, compensation files, claims for costs (files?</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">) etc.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">I would like a copy of everything thank you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">I last made a FOI/Section 59 request in 1995 so documents made prior to 27/5/1995, unless they were not previously supplied, are not needed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">I do not know whether I was to lodge my request under FOI or Section 59 as I do not know about section 59 but can you please accept whichever will provide me with full access in the most timely manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Can you please also ensure that Kristina King's notes (handwritten by Kristina) of the Conciliation meeting at the AAT in June 2002 and Comcare notes of the Directions Hearing at the AAT at the end of 1998 or 1999 are included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">" 
 
 

6 The reference to section 59 is a reference to section 59 of the SRC Act which, relevantly for these purposes, provides:
 
 " 59 Certain document to be supplied on request 
 
 
 
 
 (1) A relevant authority shall: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) on request by a claimant --- give to the claimant any document held by the authority that relates to the claimant's claim; or 
 
 
 
 ..." 
 
 
 

7 The application for access to the documents (and provision of copies of documents) was made both in accordance with the provisions of Part III of the FOI Act and section 59 of the SRC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">On 23 March 2003, the Respondent made a further request for access to "all my files under the FOI Act ... from the start of my claim" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">That request made reference to another claim or reference number described as "claim 26745/03".</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">On 8 May 2003, Comcare made a decision to release certain documents and withhold "legal advice, internal working documents in relation to legal advice and investigation documents" on the ground that those documents were exempt from disclosure by operation of section 42(1) of the FOI Act because the documents are of such a nature that they would be privileged from production in legal proceedings on the ground of legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">8 Section 42(1) of the FOI Act is in these terms:
 
 " 42 Documents subject to legal professional privilege 
 
 
 
 
 (1) A document is an exempt document if it is of such a nature that it would be privileged from production in legal proceedings on the ground of legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">
 
 ..." 
 
 
 
 

9 In construing the scope of that exemption, section 32 of the FOI Act provides:
 
 " 32 Interpretation 
 
 
 
 A provision of this Part [Part IV --- Exempt documents] by virtue of which documents referred to in the provision are exempt documents: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) shall not be construed as limited in its scope or operation in any way by any other provision of this Part by virtue of which documents are exempt documents; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) shall not be construed as not applying to a particular document by reason that another provision of this Part of a kind mentioned in paragraph (a) also applies to that document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">" 
 
 
 
 

10 On 4 June 2003, Ms Foster requested Comcare to conduct an internal review of that decision and on 30 July 2003 Comcare, having undertaken the review, decided to provide access to and copies of 16 further documents to Ms Foster and refuse access to all the remaining documents previously withheld in reliance upon section 42(1) of the FOI Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Upon review, Comcare concluded the documents were privileged from production on the ground of legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Comcare described the character of the documents as documents which: 
 
 "... are, or record, confidential communications made between Comcare and its lawyers, or confidential documents obtained or prepared for the dominant purpose of Comcare being provided with legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">In some cases, this also included the purpose of preparing for or conducting litigation to which Comcare was a party or litigation being considered by Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Comcare has not waived that legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">" 
 
 

11 Comcare also refused access to all documents contained on Comcare's investigation file (described as 226745/03) on the ground that disclosure of those documents:
 
 
 "(a) ... would disclose matter in the nature of, or relating to, opinion, advice and recommendations for the purposes of deliberative functions of the agency and be contrary to the public interest; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) ... would or would be reasonably likely to prejudice the effectiveness of measures for investigating breaches of the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">" 
 
 
 
 The statutory basis relied upon for each ground of exemption [11] was sections 36(1) and 37 (2)(b) of the FOI Act respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Section 36(1) is in these terms:
 
 
 " 36 Internal working documents 
 
 
 
 
 (1) Subject to this section, a document is an exempt document if it is a document the disclosure of which under this Act: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) would disclose matter in the nature of, or relating to, opinion, advice or recommendation obtained, prepared or recorded, or consultation or deliberation that has taken place, in the course of, or for the purposes of, the deliberative processes involved in the functions of an agency or Minister or of the Government of the Commonwealth; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) would be contrary to the public interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">" 
 
 Section 37(2)(b) is in these terms:
 
 
 
 " 37 Documents affecting enforcement of law and protection of public safety 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) A document is an exempt document if its disclosure under this Act would, or could reasonably be expected to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (b) disclose lawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or dealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law the disclosure of which would, or would be reasonably likely to, prejudice the effectiveness of those methods or procedures; 
 
 
 
 
 ..." 
 
 
 
 

12 Access was refused to some documents in reliance upon section 45 of the FOI Act on the ground that the documents "are or record material obtained by Comcare in confidence and whose disclosure would found an action for breach of confidence" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">However, those documents were documents within the category of group of documents Comcare decided were exempt under section 42(1) of the FOI Act and therefore "no purpose would be served in further identifying these documents" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">13 On 25 August 2003, Ms Foster applied to the Tribunal for a review of Comcare's decision arising out of the internal review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Subsequent to Ms Foster filing her application with the Tribunal, Comcare elected to release further documents to Ms Foster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The documents to which Comcare continues to refuse access are set out in Annexure "KAK1" to the affidavit of Kristina Anne King affirmed on 13 February 2004 and marked Exhibit 1 in the Tribunal review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Kristina King is a public servant employed as an instructing officer in the "Appeals and Review Team" within Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 refers to various documents, among others, generally described as "investigation file" and referenced as E123 and "copies of surveillance videos" referenced E124 and dated 20 July 2000 to 18 August 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">These documents (and particularly E124) are more particularly described in the affidavit of Gary King sworn 13 February 2004 and marked Exhibit 2 in the Tribunal review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">However, a confidentiality order applies to those documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Nevertheless, they are the same documents referred to generally in Annexure "KAK1" to the affidavit of Kristina King.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">A "document" for the purposes of the FOI Act includes, by section 4(1): 
 
 "(a) any of, or any part of any of, the following things: 
 
 ... 
 
 (iv) any article or material from which sounds, images or 
 
 
 
 writings are capable of being reproduced with or without the aid of any other article or device; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (v) any article on which information has been stored or recorded, either mechanically or electronically; 
 
 
 
 
 (vi) any other record of information; or 
 
 (b) any copy, reproduction or duplicate of such a thing; or 
 
 (c) any part of such a copy, reproduction or duplicate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">" 
 
 

14 As to important factual matters concerning the creation and treatment of documents falling within the schedule marked Annexure "KAK1", Kristina King says this:
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I am employed as an instructing officer in the Appeals and Review Team within Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">My role in that position includes management of Comcare's responses to applications to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of decisions made under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 ("the SRC Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Since 1999 I have had responsibility for the management of Comcare's response to 2 applications by the Applicant in this matter to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of decisions made by Comcare in relation to claims by the Applicant for compensation under the SRC Act those applications being Application Q1999/369 lodged 31 March 1999 and Application Q2002/1094 lodged 13 December 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">I am also aware that the Applicant had, prior to my involvement, lodged an earlier application, Q94/731 lodged in November 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Comcare engaged Messrs Phillips Fox, lawyers, to provide legal advice to Comcare in relation to claims by the Applicant under the SRC Act and to provide legal services to Comcare in relation to the proceedings Q1999/369 and Q2002/1094 brought in the AAT by the Applicant as listed above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Annexed hereto and marked KAK-1 is a list of documents in respect of which Comcare claims exemption from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Acct 1982.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Each of the documents listed but not struck through was created either for the dominant purpose of Messrs Phillips Fox giving or Comcare obtaining legal advice in respect of the Applicant's claims for compensation under the SRC Act or her applications to the AAT for review of decisions on such claims or for the dominant purpose of use in existing or anticipated proceedings in the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 
 
 
 
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It is the usual practice when Comcare requests or receives legal advice from external legal service providers that the matter is referred to an appropriate lawyer within that provider firm to prepare and provide the advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">One of the reasons that Comcare seeks legal advice from external legal service providers is to gain independent advice with respect to a particular matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 
 
 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">When legal advice is received from external legal service providers, it is kept separately from the claim file in a white folder specifically utilised for holding documents passing between Comcare and its external service providers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">That folder is retained within the AAT Unit of Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 
 
 
 
 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The same measures are taken when Comcare creates or obtains documents for use in existing or anticipated proceedings in the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Where other litigation proceedings are initiated, similar measures are taken, except that the white AAT folder may be retained in the Legal Services Unit of Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">" 
 
 
 

15 Accordingly, Comcare by reason of the purpose actuating the mind of Comcare's officer, Ms King, claims all the documents listed in Annexure "KAK1" (apart from expressly deleted references --- all further reference to the documents listed in Annexure "KAK1" exclude those documents in the Schedule shown with a line drawn through the particular entry) attract an exemption under the FOI Act (being the primary source of Ms Foster's application) on the ground that those documents (and the video recordings) would be privileged from production in legal proceedings (including proceedings in the performance of the Executive's administrative decision-making upon review in the Tribunal).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The same principle applies to the specifically listed documents in Annexure "GTK1" of Exhibit 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Before the Tribunal, Comcare abandoned the exemption based upon section 45 and conceded that the section 36 ground of exemption added nothing because its operation in the circumstances, turned upon whether the documents were exempt by operation of section 42(1) of the FOI Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In other words, it would be contrary to public interest to disclose documents falling within section 36(1)(a) if any such documents are of such a nature that they would be privileged from production in legal proceedings on the ground of legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">To the extent that any document within Annexure "KAK1" of Exhibit 1 withheld in reliance upon section 42(1) of the FOI Act also comprehended documents falling within section 59 of the SRC Act (and not disclosed), Comcare relied upon the privilege from production on the ground of legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It seems to be common ground between the parties that neither section 59 of the SRC Act nor the SRC Act otherwise expressly or by necessary implication abrogates the privilege from production of documents on the ground of legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">THE DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL 
 
16 On 11 November 2004, the Tribunal set aside the decision arising out of Comcare's internal review and determined that:
 
 
 (a) a number of the documents identified in the Schedule marked Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 [17 (paragraph 25 of the Reasons)] were not exempt for the purposes of section 42 of the FOI Act;
 (b) apart from any document properly attracting legal professional privilege for the purposes of section 42 of the FOI Act , a number of documents identified within Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 could not be characterised as "internal working documents" for the purposes of section 36(1) of the FOI Act and that release of those documents would neither reveal the deliberative processes of Comcare nor be contrary to the public interest; 
 (c) the surveillance videos described at E124 of the Schedule, Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1, related to Ms Foster's claim for compensation, contained personal information about her and were not exempt under either section 36 or section 42 of the FOI Act ; and
 (d) as to investigation reports, the Tribunal upheld exemptions in reliance upon sections 36 and 37 of the FOI Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 

17 As to the question of the exemption under section 42 of the FOI Act , the process of reasoning adopted by the Tribunal was this:
 
 
 "19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">In Baker v Campbell (1983) 49 ALR 385 a majority of the High Court held that the doctrine of legal professional privilege applied not only to judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings but also to situations where there are no anticipated judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 
 
 
 20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">One of the majority (Dawson J) explained the decision at page 445: 
 
 
 
 
 'But the protection which is unquestionably afforded by legal professional privilege in judicial proceedings (in this case criminal proceedings), would be set at nought if by executive or administrative processes revelation of professional confidences could be compelled, particularly if by this means evidence of them might subsequently be given in any subsequent judicial proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It is obvious, to my mind, that any person seeking advice such as must have been sought in this case would be seriously hampered in giving full instructions, as would his legal adviser be in giving advice, by the prospect that the instructions or the advice might have to be disclosed under compulsion and so become available for use, in one way or another, to his disadvantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Clearly, those instructions and the consequent advice would be likely to be relevant in establishing at least the fact of agreement, which is a necessary part of any conspiracy, and the nature of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">And yet, it is just such relevant evidence that the law excludes in judicial proceedings because of its overriding regard for the confidentiality of communications between a legal adviser and his client and it does so at the expense of the availability of the whole of the relevant evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It is hardly to be supposed that the principle which lies behind that exclusion is so narrow in its application as to be confined to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings with the result that it may be thwarted by executive or administrative processes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The decision of the High Court in Waterford v Commonwealth of Australia (1987) 71 ALR 673 put beyond doubt that documents brought into existence for the sole purpose of obtaining and giving and receiving legal advice in relation to proceedings in this Tribunal would sustain a claim for legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">There the Court referred to the sole purpose test (as explained in Grant v Downs (1976) 11 ALR 577).</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">That must now be considered in light of the Court's decision in Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">There the Court overruled Grant v Downs , holding that the test for whether legal professional privilege exists is whether the dominant purpose for which the document came into existence was the purpose of obtaining legal advice and communication of legal advice or information which may be used in existing or possible legal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Of course it is the client's privilege and may be waived by the client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 
 
 
 
 
 22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">In this case the respondent has done so in relation to some documents for which exemption is not claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">

<sentence id="s82">The following extract from the dissenting judgment of Barwick CJ in Grant v Downs at page 579-80 is the accepted statement of the law relating to legal professional privilege in Australia (and also for the purposes of section 42 of the FOI Act ): 
 
 
 
 
 
 'Having considered the decisions, the writings and the various aspects of the public interest which claim attention, I have come to the conclusion that the court should state the relevant principle as follows: a document which was produced or brought into existence either with the dominant purpose of its author, or of the person or authority under whose direction, whether particular or general, it was produced or brought into existence, of using it or its contents in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation, at the time of its production in reasonable prospect, should be privileged and excluded from inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">
 
 In the application of this principle, the fact that the person who produced, or the person or authority who or which directed the production of the document, had in mind other uses of the document will not preclude that document being accorded privilege, if it were produced with the requisite dominant purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Further, the circumstances that the document is a 'routine document' will not be definitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The dominant purpose of its production may none the less qualify it for professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Whether or not a document does so qualify is a question ultimately to be decided, if need be, upon an inspection by the judge of the document itself, and by the application of the stated principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">An example of a routine document that was held to not be privileged is the solicitor's trust account ledger considered by Connolly J in Re Packer and Others v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1983) 53 ALR 589.</sentence>

 THE RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUES 
 The Section 42 Exemption 
 
22 Comcare contends that all the documents identified in Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 (including those documents found not exempt for the purposes of section 36 of the FOI Act ) attract the privilege from disclosure on the ground of legal professional privilege and the Tribunal in determining the necessary question of fact concerning the purpose for bringing the challenged material into existence, applied an incorrect test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">In Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at page 70, para [52] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ observed:
 
 "A claim for privilege is not conclusively established by the use of a verbal formula.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">A court has power to examine documents in cases where there is a disputed claim and it should not be hesitant to exercise such a power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">In appropriate cases, there is also a power to allow cross-examination of a deponent of an affidavit claiming privilege"; 
 
 
 and in Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 692, Jacobs J observed: 
 
 
 "I think that the question which the court should pose to itself is this --- does the purpose of supplying the material to the legal adviser account for the existence of the material?</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">I use the word purpose here in the sense of intention --- the intended use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The question is one of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">In some cases, a mere general description of documents in an affidavit of discovery may indicate an affirmative answer without any need further to examine the documents or the circumstances in which they came into existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">In other cases, both an examination of the documents and the surrounding circumstances may be necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">" 
 
 

23 In the proceedings before the Tribunal, Ms King was cross-examined by Ms Foster on aspects of her affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Primarily, Ms Foster's questions were directed to the nature of the documents making up Annexure "KAK1".</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The Tribunal member examined each of the documents identified in Annexure "KAK1" and made a finding of fact that the documents described at paragraph 25 of the Reasons were not prepared for the dominant purpose of Comcare acquiring and Comcare's external independent lawyers, Phillips Fox, providing legal advice nor for the dominant purpose of Comcare being provided with legal services in relation to the proceedings before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Those conclusions are determinations on questions of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">24 The first question is whether in determining that question, the Tribunal applied an incorrect legal test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">25 The Applicant's central argument is simply this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">A proper reading of the Reasons of the Tribunal and particularly paragraph 26 of the Reasons suggest that the Tribunal member reached the finding that the documents described at paragraph 25 were not prepared for the dominant purpose of Comcare acquiring and Phillips Fox providing legal advice nor the provision and acquisition of legal services in connection with the proceedings for the reason that "most of the documents are purely procedural and only refer to information on the public record " .</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The contention is that the final sentence of paragraph 26 is not simply an observational statement but rather an explanation of the deliberative process applied to each of the documents described in paragraph 25 of the Reasons to determine the question of whether the claim for legal professional privilege was made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The Reasons of the Tribunal member do not address, in terms, the evidence of Ms King in detail and particularly the formulation adopted at paragraph 4 of the affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The process, correctly, was to take each of the documents in respect of which a claim for legal professional privilege was made and make an assessment of whether each particular document was, as Ms King claims:
 
 
 (a) created either for the dominant purpose of Messrs Phillips Fox giving or Comcare obtaining legal advice in respect of the Applicant's claims for compensation under the SRC Act or her applications to the AAT for review of decisions on such claims; or
 (b) for the dominant purpose of use in existing or anticipated proceedings in the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">
 

26 In effect, the Tribunal rejected the evidence of Ms King so far as the claim related to those documents described at paragraph 25 of the Reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">In rejecting that evidence, the final sentence of paragraph 26 seems, fairly read, to suggest that the question of whether the documents referred to information on the public record and whether the documents reflected material which was purely procedural was determinative of whether the documents were brought into existence for the relevant dominant purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">27 If so, the test applied by the Tribunal member miscarried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">28 As to the question of information on the public record an example might be this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Suppose a senior officer of a corporation such as a chief executive officer or chief financial officer approaches a solicitor or counsel or both for the purpose of determining whether the corporation might encounter legal obstacles in effecting a merger with another corporation or an acquisition of the shares or assets of another corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">A question would arise as to whether such conduct might involve, for example, a contravention of section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) on the basis that the acquisition would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in a market and if so, what remedial consequences might arise at the suit of the regulator or an affected party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">A lawyer asked to advise on that question, having obtained particular material and oral and written instructions from the corporation's officers, might access the website for each corporation involved and access and print documents from that site dealing with the detailed scope of operations, concentration ratios, market share, asset details, quarterly briefings, description of market influences etc, access the website for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and print a copy of the current merger guidelines, recently posted reasons for informal merger approvals, determinations and other material, access the Australian Stock Exchange website and obtain copies of disclosure statements and releases published to the Exchange, obtain copies of annual reports of each corporation and other briefing statements to funds managers and other publicly available documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">29 All of that material, gathered together by the lawyers for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice to the corporate client, attracts privilege from disclosure on the ground of legal professional privilege notwithstanding that the material gathered for the purpose of critical assessment in forming views about components of the legal questions, is drawn from information on the public record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The client enjoys an immunity from disclosure of the printed versions of electronic material or copies of documents gathered from public databases and registers because disclosure of those documents would reveal confidential communications between the lawyer and the client concerning the seeking and giving of legal advice on the various issues comprehended by the legal questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">30 As to the question of whether the documents, upon examination, reflect purely procedural matters, an assessment of the content of those documents is relevant to the question of whether the document was brought into existence for the asserted dominant purpose when testing the affidavit affirming the facts providing the foundation for the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">However, the content of the document is not determinative of the factual question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">As Barwick CJ observed in Grant v Downs (1976) 11 ALR 577 at 579-580: "The circumstance that the document is a 'routine document' will not be definitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The dominant purpose of its production may nonetheless qualify it for professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Whether or not a document does so qualify is a question ultimately to be decided, if need be, upon an inspection by the judge of the document itself and by the application of the stated principle ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">
 
31 The accepted principles to be applied in the determination of the factual questions are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Although views might differ ( Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Limited &amp; Ors (1996 --- 1997) [1997] HCA 3 ; 188 CLR 501 ( "Propend Finance" ) per Gummow J at page 564) as to whether the privilege is to be characterised as a practical guarantee of fundamental, constitutional or human rights ( Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 490), a substantive rule of law ( Carter v Northmore Hale Davy &amp; Leake [1995] HCA 33 ; (1995) 183 CLR 121 at 161) or a traditional common law right which is not to be abolished or cut down otherwise than by clear statutory provision ( Bropho v Western Australia [1990] HCA 24 ; (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 17-18), it is now clear that legal professional privilege is a rule of substantive law available to a person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents which would reveal communications between a client and his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services, including representation in legal proceedings: The Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543 (" Daniels Corporation" ) at page 552 [9] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">32 Legal professional privilege is not merely a rule of evidence but an important common law immunity not confined to the processes of discovery and inspection or the giving of evidence in judicial proceedings: Daniels Corporation at 552 and 553 [10] and [11]; Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 ( "Esso Australia" ), Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 73 [61].</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">33 The test is "anchored to the purpose for which the document was brought into existence"; Propend Finance per Brennan CJ at page 508 and the privilege "protects the confidentiality of documents produced for the purpose of communication between a potential litigant and the legal adviser and confidentiality facilitates the administration of justice" : Propend Finance per Brennan CJ at page 508.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Although the reasoning in a number of authorities proceeds on a false premise that what is involved is privilege for particular documents rather than communications, ( Propend Finance , per Gummow J at page 569), " communications with one's legal adviser for the [dominant] purpose are privileged from disclosure and this privilege extends to the various components of a communication" : Propend Finance , per Gummow J at page 571.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">34 The determination of whether the privilege or immunity is properly established is "not a question of extracting one or other of what may be numerous documents all of which form part of the privileged communication ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The communication as a whole is protected to foster the confidential relationship in which legal advice is given and received and thereby to advance the respect for an observance of the law" : Propend Finance , per Gummow J at page 571.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">35 Where the communication is constituted by or recorded in a document, the document is merely evidence of the communication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">When privilege is claimed for a document, it is because it records or constitutes a communication prepared, given or received for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or assistance: Esso Australia , per McHugh J, at page 79 [80].</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Further, "it is the purpose of the communication that is decisive, not the purpose in making the document... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">[The] document evidences a privileged communication : Esso Australia per McHugh J at page 80 [81].</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">36 In the joint judgment of Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ in Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 687-688, the adoption of a sole purpose test was in part influenced by a concern that where a multiplicity of purposes existed for the preparation of documents, many routine documents passing between management officers within an agency or corporation would also be provided to internal lawyers for a purpose of obtaining legal advice and that many such routine documents would become privileged "merely because one of their intended destinations was the desk of a lawyer" : Esso Australia at page 67 [43] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In the course of confidential communications between a client and his or her lawyer a number of documents may be generated which objectively might be characterised as routine either in the course of giving or obtaining legal advice or the supply and acquisition of legal services including representation and legal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The question is whether the communications of which the documents are a component, were made for the dominant purpose asserted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">37 Although legal professional privilege has been described as " an ancient doctrine which has assumed a life of its own " ( Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice (supra) per Mason J and Brennan J at page 487), the privilege is based upon encouraging full and frank confidential disclosures between a solicitor and client in order to enhance and assist the administration of justice and therefore the determination of rights and interests according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The antiquity of the importance of the relationship between the legal adviser and client in the administration of justice and the preservation of rights and interests according to law was recognised in Shakespeare's dialogue between the conspirators, Cade and Dick in Henry VI, Part 2 when Dick in response to Cade's description of the tyrannical and discretionary character of life and rights in England under Cade's proposed rule, responded, "The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">38 In the present case, the evidence before the Tribunal was that the documents identified at paragraph 25 of the Reasons of the Tribunal were created for the dominant purpose of Comcare's independent lawyers giving and Comcare obtaining legal advice in respect of the claims by Ms Foster for compensation or her applications to the AAT for review of those claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Alternatively, the dominant purpose involved use of the documents in the existing proceedings or proceedings then anticipated by Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">The evidence was that Comcare had retained independent legal advisers, the point of intersection between Comcare and the independent advisers was Ms King or other officers within the "Appeals and Review Team", that Ms King had administrative responsibility for managing the claims by Ms Foster and Comcare's response to those claims, that Comcare was seeking advice, independent of Comcare, on Ms Foster's claims and Tribunal proceedings and that advice from the independent lawyers is kept physically separate from other material such as administrative material passing between internal officers within Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">39 The question to be determined is not whether the material is routine and thus the evidence of dominant purpose to be rejected but whether, although routine, the material was brought into existence as part of, or evidence of, or components of, confidential communications between Comcare and its lawyers for the dominant purpose of Phillips Fox giving and Comcare obtaining legal advice or the provision and acquisition of legal services including representation in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">If so, the sequence of letters reflected in Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 are all privileged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">40 Accordingly, the decision of the Tribunal in relation to the assessment of whether those documents identified in Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 evidence such a communication should be set aside and the matter referred to the Tribunal for consideration of whether the letters identified at Annexure "KAK1" of Exhibit 1, although reflecting routine or purely procedural matter or information on the public record, are components of a confidential communication between Comcare and its independent lawyers for the dominant purpose asserted in the affidavit of Ms King reflected at [14] and [25] and thus the determination of the factual question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The Surveillance Videos 
 
41 The second question concerns E124 in Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The Tribunal concluded that the surveillance videos identified as Document E124 in Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 relate to a claim by Ms Foster for compensation and to the extent that the surveillance videos contain personal information about Ms Foster, the videos do not constitute an exempt document under section 42 and therefore are not properly the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege (apart from any question of whether an exemption might arise under sections 36 or 37 of the FOI Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Comcare contends that the circumstance that the surveillance videos contain personal information about Ms Foster does not operate to deprive Comcare of the exemption if the surveillance videos were brought into existence for the dominant purpose identified by Ms King at [14] and [25].</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Comcare further contends that Ms King's evidence is supported by paragraph 2 of the affidavit of Gary King, Exhibit 2, to the effect that Comcare directly undertook inquiries itself and engaged private investigators to conduct investigations on factual issues "in preparation for the proceedings in the AAT" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The facts and circumstances deposed to by Gary King were not contradicted before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Documents identified in Annexure "GTK1" to the affidavit of Gary King referred to the commissioning of private investigators to conduct surveillance by video recording in preparation for the Tribunal proceedings [documents 5, 7, 8, 13 to 21, 25, 38 to 40 at pages 56 to 62 of the Appeal Book].</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">42 Ms Foster contends, in reliance upon Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 at 122 - 123 and Propend Finance particularly at pages 515 --- 516 per Dawson J that no privilege can subsist for physical objects other than documents and since the privilege is a function of communications between a lawyer and a client for the relevant dominant purpose, it is the communication which is the subject of the immunity and not the document or thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">In Propend Finance , Dawson J made the observation at page 515 that to say a document is privileged is merely a "shorthand way" of saying that the "communication" constituted by the document is privileged which was an expression of opinion consistent with the view His Honour had expressed in Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 at 122 when his Honour said the privilege attaches only to communications "made for the purpose of giving or receiving advice or for use in existing or anticipated litigation" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">His Honour further said in Propend Finance at page 516 that legal professional privilege does not "protect a document from disclosure as a mere physical object any more than it protects from disclosure any other physical object" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">43 His Honour, in those observations, is not suggesting that a document which is brought into existence for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services including representation in legal proceedings is susceptible to disclosure because the privilege, properly understood, is a function of communications between the lawyer and the client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">As Gummow J observed in Propend Finance at page 517, the privilege derived from communications with one's legal adviser for the relevant dominant purpose "extends to the various components of a communication" and to the extent that a document thus brought into existence is the expression of that communication it becomes the evidence of the communication as McHugh J observed in Esso Australia at page 80 [81].</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The distinction His Honour was drawing was both to identify analytically the proper basis for the subsistence of the privilege and to illustrate the circumstances in which, for example, a document per se is not privileged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">At page 516 of Propend Finance , His Honour observed, after the passage quoted above:
 
 "That is why a document which has been brought into existence otherwise than as a communication between client and legal adviser seeking or giving advice or for use in existing or anticipated litigation does not attract a privilege: it is not a communication which has its origin in that confidential relationship between client and legal adviser that it is the purpose of the privilege to protect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">It is why a document which merely evidences a transaction --- a contract, for example --- which is not a communication seeking or giving legal advice or for use in the conduct of litigation (in the sense that it pre-exists in any actual or anticipated litigation) does not attract legal professional privilege, even if it is subsequently given to the legal adviser for the purpose of seeking advice or for use in litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">" 
 
 

44 In this case, the evidence is the surveillance videos were brought into existence for the dominant purpose of a communication between Comcare and its lawyers for anticipated use in legal proceedings and was confidential between Comcare and the investigator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">45 Ms Foster further relies upon the decision of French J in J-Corp Ltd v Australian Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers (Western Australian Branch) (1992) 38 FCR 452 ( "J-Corp") .</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">In those proceedings, J-Corp Pty Ltd sought injunctive relief and damages against the Australian Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers (Western Australian Branch) (BLF) in respect of alleged contraventions of section 45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Other respondent unions were joined in those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The matter of relevance for present purposes is that the BLF made arrangements for video tape recordings to be made of events which took place at the applicant's Rivervale building site when the BLF and other respondents established a picket line which was said to have the effect of obstructing or hindering the supply of goods and services to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The BLF contended that the video tapes were made in anticipation of and for the purposes of legal proceedings and were thus the subject of legal professional privilege affording an immunity against disclosure of the video tapes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">46 In considering the merits of those contentions and the jurisprudential foundation for the subsistence of legal professional privilege, His Honour at page 457 made these observations:
 
 "The video tapes have, it may be accepted, been brought into existence for the sole purpose of possible litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">
 
 They are in one sense analogous to witness statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">But they are more than that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">
 
 They are real evidence of events which occurred in public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">They were not taken in circumstances to which any confidentiality attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">To attach legal professional privilege to these materials would be to accord excessive respect to the adversarial aspects of litigation and insufficient weight to the objective of determining in litigation the facts in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">To allow inspection of these materials, in my opinion, infringes no public interest and no established category of privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">
 
 Discovery of the tapes has effectively been given by Mr Farrell's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">" 
 
 

47 The High Court in 1997, 1999 and 2002 in Propend Finance , Esso Australia and Daniels Corporation established that legal professional privilege, once properly attracted on the facts, is an important substantive right or common law immunity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Its attraction is a function of whether, so far as the surveillance videos are concerned, they are the emanation of communications made for the dominant purpose of giving or retaining legal advice or the provision of legal services including representation in legal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">48 The point of departure between the facts of this case and those reflected in J-Corp lie in the apparent public nature of the recording of the public events surrounding the picket line which prima facie failed to comprehend the necessary quality of confidentiality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">In other words, the material was not gathered as a function of a confidential communication between lawyer and client notwithstanding that the sole purpose for making a video recording of the picket line was for submission of the video to the lawyers for the BLF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">49 In Boyes v Colins (2000) 23 WAR 123, an intermediate Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal of Western Australia, took a different approach to aspects of the reasoning of His Honour in J-Corp .</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">In Boyes v Colins , the respondent was in possession of a surveillance video made of the appellant in relation to claims made by the appellant of certain physical disabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The respondent had caused the video of the appellant to be made for the purposes of the litigation and proposed to rely upon the video at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Ipp J with whom Pidgeon and Wallwork JJ agreed observed that in Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674, Jacobs J had said at page 690, "Communications with one's legal adviser are privileged from disclosure and ... that privilege extends not only to communications actually made but to material prepared for the purpose of communication thereof to the legal adviser" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Thus, material furnished to the solicitor such as a witness statement to assist in contemplated litigation is privileged and on the same basis, the provision of the video film by the photographer to the respondent's solicitor must, consistent with principle, be regarded as a communication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">In any event, in reliance upon a considerable body of authority, Ipp J concluded that legal professional privilege in relation to communications involving representation in actual or threatened legal proceedings does not depend upon information being "communicated".</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">50 The point of departure with the reasoning of His Honour in J-Corp by the Court of Appeal involved the notion that describing the video images as "real evidence" or direct evidence of matters in issue did not assist in determining whether legal professional privilege subsisted in respect of the communication of the video.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The ordinary rules of privilege must apply and in the face of those rules, properly applied according to the proven facts as a matter of common law immunity, there was no "discretionary power" to compel the respondent to disclose the video film and compel waiver of the privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">51 There seems to be no real point of distinction between the principles which should apply to the surveillance videos and witness statements brought into existence for the purposes of litigation of the issues in controversy between parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The privilege once established may involve a number of further considerations including whether the client has waived the privilege directly through intentional disclosure, whether the client has waived the privilege by implication and whether the circumstances are such that the necessary element of confidentiality in communication, such as in the case of J-Corp , is lacking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It may be that His Honour in J-Corp although he was not directly dealing with the question of implied waiver, had in mind some of the notions which influenced that consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">For example, in Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at pages 487 and 488, Mason and Brennan JJ discussed the notion that circumstances might arise where by reason of some conduct on the part of the privilege holder, it becomes unfair to maintain or extend the privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Their Honours observed that the holder of such a privilege should not be able to "abuse it by using it to create an inaccurate perception of the proposed communication" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Similarly, His Honour Deane J observed at page 493 that a person may use privileged material in such a way that it would be unfair for him to assert the immunity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">52 In the circumstances of the present case, the notion that the video material related to a claim for compensation made by Ms Foster and contained personal information about her provides no basis for rejecting what would otherwise be a proper attraction of legal professional privilege on the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Accordingly, the Tribunal in finding that the surveillance videos are not exempt documents for the purpose of section 42 of the FOI Act applied an incorrect test to the operation and application of section 42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">53 Accordingly:
 
 
 (a) the circumstances reflected at paragraphs 1(a), (b) and (c) of [20] do not render legal professional privilege inapplicable to a document or part of a document brought into existence for the dominant purpose of aiding a party in actual or anticipated proceedings in a Court or Administrative Tribunal;
 (b) for the reasons identified at [22] to [39], the Tribunal applied considerations (in determining whether the documents identified in paragraph 25 of the Reasons and paragraphs 38 and 39 of the Reasons attracted legal professional privilege), inconsistent with the correct legal test of whether the documents, although reflecting routine or purely procedural matter or information on the public record, are components of a confidential communication between Comcare and its independent lawyers for the dominant purpose asserted in the affidavit of Ms King reflected at [14] and [25];
 (c) having regard to the considerations applied by the Tribunal reflected in the Reasons, it was not open to the Tribunal to conclude that legal professional privilege did not apply to the documents identified in paragraph 25 of the Reasons and paragraphs 38 and 39 of the Reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">
 

54 The appeal will be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The Tribunal's decision will be set aside and the question of whether the documents listed in paragraph 25 of the Tribunal's Reasons are exempt for the purposes of section 42 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 shall be remitted to the Tribunal for determination according to law.</sentence>

1 On 18 November 2005 I published reasons for judgment in this proceeding; see Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1662.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">On that day the Court ordered the reinstatement of Mr Colin Williams and deferred consideration of penalty and compensation pending the receipt of written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">These reasons for judgment should be read together with the reasons for judgment published on 18 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Penalty 
 
2 The following observations made in the previous judgment are relevant to penalty:
 
 &#8226; Mr Pillen's refusal to accept the existence of a dispute; [16]
 &#8226; The decision to conduct the stop work meeting at the time it was held arose from Mr Pillen's refusal to acknowledge the existence of a dispute; [17]
 &#8226; It would have been more appropriate, notwithstanding the above point, to hold the meeting at lunchtime; [53]
 &#8226; The "overbearing and provocative" manner in which Mr Minniti spoke to Mr Williams; [24]
 &#8226; The different treatment accorded to other employees who had taken strike action but were not disciplined; [29], [43]
 &#8226; The failure to engage the disciplinary code suggested strongly that Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti were keen to be rid of Mr Williams; [37]
 &#8226; That Mr Williams' status as team coordinator did not affect the decision to terminate him; [38], [43]
 &#8226; The breach of s 298K of the Act was blatant and serious; [51], [71]
 &#8226; "ACI desired to be rid of Mr Williams, who it saw as an active shop steward ... who had given it some grief on industrial issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">" [52] 

3 Counsel for ACI submitted that the decision to terminate Mr Williams was made in response to what Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti understood was Mr Williams' conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Counsel also contended that it was action which Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti believed they were entitled to take under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The decision was opportunistic and not premeditated, counsel submitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 Even if it is accepted that the decision was an opportunistic one, it was nonetheless unlawful and, in the circumstances set out in the previous judgment, it constituted a blatant and serious breach of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">I do not accept the submission that the termination of Mr Williams flowed from a failure to appreciate the scope of s 298L(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti are both experienced in industrial relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">They should not have been in any doubt about the illegality of their conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 I reject the contention that Mr Minniti's reaction to Mr Williams' putting the telephone down showed that Mr Minniti was merely reacting to provocation rather than acting in deliberate defiance of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Minniti had the opportunity to put a considered recommendation to Mr Gillholme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The recommendation was not a spur of the moment decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 Mr Williams' failure to hold the meeting at lunchtime should be considered as only a minor mitigating factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">To class it as a major mitigating factor would reward Mr Pillen's even more inappropriate conduct in failing to accept the existence of a dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 I further reject the submission that Mr Williams' status as team co-ordinator was "an ameliorating circumstance".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Such a contention is inconsistent with the reasons for judgment of 18 November 2005, in which the Court found that Mr Williams' status as a team coordinator was not a basis for his termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 I agree with the submission of counsel for ACI that the Court should not take into account the breach of the disciplinary code, in itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">However, as counsel for the Union submitted, adherence to the code may have avoided the situation which ACI now finds itself in as a result of its summary dismissal of Mr Williams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">9 An examination of the relevant facts shows that two senior industrial relations managers, in important roles, made a decision to terminate the employment of an active shop steward, whose industrial representation of the members of the Union working at ACI had displeased them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In the circumstances, a penalty in the high range of those available is appropriate, but for the matters set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">10 I now turn to the other factors relevant to the question of penalty as discussed by Branson J in Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) (1999) 94 IR 231, as foreshadowed at [79] in the previous judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">11 There is no evidence that ACI has previously contravened Pt XA of the Act, or any predecessor provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">That is a mitigating factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">12 Given that Mr Williams has been reinstated and that ACI has been admonished for its conduct in the 18 November 2005 judgment, there are no continuing consequences in respect of ACI's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">13 The protection of industrial freedom of association and, in this case, freedom of representation, has been upheld by the reinstatement order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">14 The maximum penalty available to the Court is 300 penalty units or $33,000, see s 298U(a)(i) of the Act and s 4AA(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">15 Having regard to the totality of the above matters I consider that a mid-range penalty is appropriate and set the penalty at $16,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">16 There is no reason why the penalty should not be paid to the Union; see Finance Section Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1847 at [71] , per Merkel J and s 356(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Compensation 
 
17 The Union does not currently press for an order for the payment of compensation to Mr Williams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Counsel for the Union informed the Court that ACI has, since 18 November 2005, agreed to make adjustments necessary to ensure Mr Williams' financial position is restored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However, counsel noted that the agreement between the parties had not been fully implemented and submitted that the Court should defer consideration of compensation to allow the agreement to be implemented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">18 It is preferable to allow sufficient time to elapse to permit the parties' agreement to take effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I will place the onus on the Union to re-agitate this issue within 28 days of these reasons for judgment, failing which there will be no order made under s 298U(c) concerning compensation and the file will be closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Should the Union wish to re-agitate this issue the Court will convene a directions hearing at 10.15 am on 14 March 2005 to deal with that aspect of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Orders 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Pursuant to s 298U(a)(i) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) a penalty of $16,500 be imposed on the respondent for its contravention of s 298K(1)(a) of the Act for the prohibited reason referred to in s 298L(1)(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">

2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Pursuant to s 356(b) of the Act the penalty be paid to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The applicant have liberty to apply to the Court within 28 days of the date of this order, for an order requiring the respondent to pay to Mr Colin Williams an amount by way of compensation as the Court thinks appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In the event of liberty to apply under Order 3 not being availed of in the time permitted, the Court will make no order for compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">

 The circumstances of the applicants to the present dispute and the nature and implications of their business and operational activities relevant thereto 
 
1 The first applicant, WorldAudio Limited ('WAL'), is a public company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, having approximately 1200 ordinary shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Its principal business is the sale of broadcast airtime to advertisers, per medium of commercial radio broadcasting services, at some 50 locations around Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The second applicant AusCoast Broadcasting Pty Limited ('AusCoast') is a wholly owned subsidiary of WAL and has been since February 2002, when WAL acquired the total AusCoast shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">AusCoast holds a Medium Frequency Narrowband Area Service ('MF NAS') radiocommunications apparatus licence issued under s 100(1) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992 (Cth) ('the Act'), being licence number 1130030 (the '1620 licence').</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Broadly speaking, it is in the nature of a transmitter licence , in contrast to a receiver licence , those being the two types of apparatus licence available under s 97 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In turn, there are several types of transmitter licences provided for by the Act, the 1620 licence being described by the applicants as 'a broadcasting license type'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">A ' broadcasting station ' is defined by s 5 of the Act to mean:
 
 'a transmitter that is operating for the purposes of: 
 
 
 (a) a broadcasting services bands licence; or 
 (b) the provision of a national broadcasting service within the meaning of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 
 
 

2 WorldAudio Communications Pty Limited ('the Broadcaster'), being a further subsidiary of WAL, holds an Australia-wide commercial radio broadcasting licence under s 40 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), being licence No 1170227.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">That legislation does not fall for scrutiny in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The broadcasting services of the Broadcaster are presently transmitted in the Brisbane area by AusCoast under the auspices of the 1620 licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">For convenience, and in line with the applicants' written submissions, those services transmitted in the Brisbane area are hereafter referred to as 'the broadcasting service'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">An independent engineering report prepared for WAL by THL Australia Pty Ltd, said by the applicants to be one of Asia Pacific's leading broadcast engineering groups, was to the effect that the 1620 licence provides a signal of 'superior listening quality' to 1,150,065 persons in the Brisbane area, and of so-called 'acceptable listening quality' to a further 882,596 persons in the Brisbane area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">3 The statutory scheme for licensing the use of spectrum under the Act has been administered by the respondent Australian Communications and Media Authority ('the Authority' or 'ACMA'), and its precursor the Australian Communications Authority, since 1 July 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Prior to that time, the administration of licensing was undertaken by the Spectrum Management Agency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Nothing turns however on those changes in identity of the administering authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The statutory scheme contains provisions, in addition to the issue of apparatus licences, in relation to the duration of apparatus licences (s 103), the general conditions of apparatus licences (s 107), additional conditions of apparatus licences (s 108), changes to conditions of apparatus licences (s 111), the making of guidelines that the Authority is to apply in exercising its powers under sections 107, 108 and 111 (s 112), the suspension or cancellation of apparatus licences (ss 126 and 128 ), the renewal of apparatus licences (s 130) , and the transfer of apparatus licences (ss 131AA and 131AB).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 One of the conditions of the 1620 licence, apparently imposed from the time of its first issue, is that the location of the transmitter be 170 Kingsley Terrace, Manly, being a suburb of Brisbane; that site was referred to in the course of the proceedings as the 'condition site'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">That condition was imposed pursuant to s 107(1)(g) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Other conditions relate to various technical aspects of the radiocommunications transmission authorised by the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In spite of that condition, transmission of the broadcasting service has never occurred in any physically operative sense from that site at Manly, that is, from the condition site, at least for the reason that the condition site is located within an established residential area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The broadcasting service is presently transmitted from a different location in the Brisbane area, being 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa, which is 5.7 kilometres distant from the condition site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">That site at Tingalpa is sometimes referred to in the parties' submissions as the 'current site', in contrast to the 'condition site' at Manly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The effect of the purported decision of the respondent Authority, the subject of the present review application, which was made on 30 June 2005 and affirmed on 18 August 2005, is that AusCoast is not officially authorised to transmit the broadcasting service, or any other radiocommunications service, from the current site, without breaching the locational condition of the 1620 licence referrable to Manly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">That prohibition, if enforced, would apparently mean that the broadcasting service of the Broadcaster must cease to be transmitted in the Brisbane metropolitan area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">So much would occasion substantial loss and damage, both directly and indirectly, as the applicants understandably emphasised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">5 As I have already indicated, there is not, nor has there ever been, any radiocommunications transmitter located at the condition site at Manly, that site being located within a residential area of Brisbane and itself comprising residential premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">When application was originally made by AusCoast for the 1620 licence, it appears that the condition site at Manly was used by AusCoast as the nominal location site for the 1620 licence because of an inability of AusCoast to identify a suitable location elsewhere for transmission of its broadcasting service to Brisbane, pending proper planning for transmission of radio communications under that licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The adoption of that course of purported expediency was said by Mr Thompson, the chief executive officer of WAL, to accord with the then practice of administrative convenience in operation at that time in respect of applications for and adoption of transmitter licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">As I have foreshadowed, that practice was said to allow an applicant for a MF NAS apparatus licence to identify a convenient address for the transmission site referrable to the applicant's licence, pending completion of comprehensive planning for transmission of radiocommunications under the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In fact an application appears to have been made by AusCoast for the change of the transmission site from Manly to another site in the Brisbane locality as far back as 12 November 1996, it being doubtless considered that it would be highly unlikely that the necessary town planning approval could ever be obtained to operate the 1620 licence from within the Manly residential area, owing to the environmental implications that might have ensued to an area of land so zoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">A precedent for that practice was identified by the applicants as the MF NAS apparatus licence for Hobart, which was listed nominally by reference to the site of the Hobart Fire Station, even though such location could not constitute a radiocommunications site in any operational physical sense for radio interference reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">6 On 29 August 2003, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (the 'Minister') issued Australian Communication Authority Direction (MF NAS Transmitter Licences) Direction No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">1 of 2003, the practical effect of which was contended by the applicants to be that the holders of MF NAS apparatus licences, such as AusCoast, would not be permitted to transmit a commercial radio broadcasting service under a licence of that designation, unless the service was provided by 29 August 2004 (ie within one year later).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">7 AusCoast commenced transmission of the subject broadcasting service on 5 November 2003 from the current site at 320 Fleming Street, Tingalpa, in alleged satisfaction of the Minister's direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It appears that the transmission of the subject broadcasting service of AusCoast has thereafter continued unabated from the Tingalpa site, and there further appears to have been no complaint communicated to any of the parties to the proceedings, including the Authority, as to AusCoast's transmission of its broadcasting service from the Tingalpa site having caused any interference to any other radiocommunication transmission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">8 It was the applicants' further case that the current site is an established radiocommunications transmission site, and that its utilisation by AusCoast for that purpose has complied with all relevant town planning, local government and environmental laws, whereas the condition site remains as I have already indicated within a residential area, in relation to which it is highly unlikely any corresponding requisite approvals could ever be obtained in relation thereto; for one matter, there is a block of residential units standing in the immediate vicinity of the Manly transmission site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It was therefore that on 6 August 2004, AusCoast applied to the then relevant authority to change the site condition of the 1620 licence from its nominal location in Manly to its operative broadcasting site at Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In the course of the communications which ensued, the Authority alleged that the broadcasting service being provided, in effect under the auspices of the 1620 licence, was being operated in breach of licence conditions, by virtue of transmission occurring from a site otherwise than that stated in the condition to the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">9 On receipt of that application of 6 August 2004, the Authority responded by fax of 16 August 2004 to the effect that any such variation of the site condition in respect of the 1620 licence was not acceptable, for the reason that it '... would put the station closer to an adjacent [channel] service on 1611kHz at Tingalpa and less than 30km from an adjacent channel service on 1629kHz at Mango Hill ... [and the transmission site] would be closer to a co-channel service at Toowoomba.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">' Of course there existed a degree of artificiality in relation to the expression '... place the transmitter closer...', the placement of the transmitter apparatus being already physically located at Tingalpa, and having never been physically located at Manly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">10 I should perhaps incorporate reference to further terminologies, practices and policies appearing in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">A 'co-channel service' is another service broadcasting at the same frequency whereas an 'adjacent channel service' would be one broadcasting at either of the two frequencies each side of the subject apparatus licence, namely 1611 kHz and 1629 kHz in the present circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The use of the expression 'closer' by the Authority's officer in the fax of 16 August 2005 is a reference to the application of the so-called '30/160 rule' which rule is enumerated in two policy documents of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The first document is a 'Business Operating Procedure' entitled 'Licensing Narrowband Area Service stations' ('NAS BOP') and the second document is a 'policy information paper' entitled 'Apparatus Licensing --- Narrowband Area Service stations' ('NAS PIP').</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In effect, those policies stipulate a minimum separation distance between MF NAS transmitters on co-channel frequencies of 160 kilometres and for adjacent channels of 30 kilometres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Since in the past the enforcement of those minimum separation distances has not always been strict on the part of the Authority (or its predecessors), it has also formulated the 'make it better rule', whereby suggested variations in site location that do not satisfy the '30/160 rule', but which are an improvement on the status quo in terms of the distances between transmission services, may be approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">11 Subsequently by letter dated 5 October 2004 a further Authority communication informed WAL inter alia that its application dated 6 August 2004 to relocate the 1620 licence had 'not been finalised' because '... the site co-ordinates that you provided do not meet, or improve, co-channel separation distances'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Interestingly in the light of the Authority's present submissions, the author of the letter then went on to request 'within one month of today, additional site co-ordinates information and/or details of how [WAL] propose to regularise the operation of [the 1620 licence]', and said that 'this correspondence is to be taken as a request for additional information for the purposes of s 286 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">' That requested information was apparently provided to the Authority by WAL in a letter dated 27 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">By letter of 15 November 2004, the Authority acknowledged WAL's ongoing efforts to resolve its site difficulties, but indicated nevertheless that the broadcasting service was operating 'in breach of licence conditions'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">No express mention was apparently made in that correspondence of 15 November 2004 to WAL's 'application...to relocate [the 1620 licence]', as that application was described in the Authority's earlier letter of 5 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">12 Two file notes authored by respective officers of the Authority evidence telephone discussions apparently undertaken by those same officers of the Authority with Mr Thompson of WAL in late 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In both of those file notes, the Authority's officers claim to have impressed upon Mr Thompson that the Authority 'had already considered the matter [of the variation of the site condition on the 1620 licence]' and had 'arrived at its current position'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">On the second occasion Mr Thompson was apparently invited to make another request in writing, which he duly did by letter dated 13 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">That letter sought both the relocation of the 1620 licence to the Tingalpa site but also the revocation of MF NAS apparatus licence number 1402943 ('the 1611 licence'), which had as its site condition a location also in Tingalpa some 7.5 kilometres away from AusCoast's current transmission site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">13 At this point of the narrative of material circumstances, I would revert back in time to 27 February 1996, being some five months after the issue originally of the 1620 licence to AusCoast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">At that time in 1996, so the applicants pointed out, the 1611 licence was registered in the name of Queensland Hospital Radio Association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The site of the 1611 licence shown in records maintained by the Authority is presently recorded as Bracken Ridge Reservoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Until January 2005, the 1611 licence, that being of course to be distinguished from the applicants' 1620 licence, had a different site location, recorded as being in Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">However by about the commencement of 2005, a change to the present 1611 licence site at Bracken Ridge Reservoir was approved by the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Bracken Ridge Reservoir site is 21063 kilometres distant from the condition site at Manly, and 18.291 kilometres distant from the current site at Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Yet the 1611 licence is inoperative and has never operated, so the applicants maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Those circumstances were raised by the applicants by way of apparent exemplification of at least the alleged elasticity of administration and operation of the Act relevantly to the nomination of site locations of licensees for convenience until an appropriate transmitter site can be found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The fact that the 1611 licence had issued some five months after the 1620 licence was said to be explanatory of the request made by WAL to the Authority for the revocation of the 1611 licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">That request, and the events occasioning it, are not of course directly relevant to the present proceedings, but provides potentially relevant background to the principal case of the applicants to be presented, in the event that the applicants are successful in the present interlocutory dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">14 Further discussions and communications have ensued between WAL and the Authority concerning the possibility of AusCoast continuing to transmit from Tingalpa, in circumstances which nevertheless were described on behalf of the Authority as already involving breach of licence conditions, though pending resolution of what an officer of the Authority described as AusCoast's attempts to acquire another licence located at Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">By letter dated 23 December 2004, the Authority purported to 'reiterate its advice to [WAL] of 26 August 2004 that [the Tingalpa site] is unsuitable because it does not meet co-channel or adjacent channel re-use distances for a number of services...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Next followed a description of the respective services which were said by the Authority to render the request for variation of the site location to involve breach of the Authority's policy on technical requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">There followed on 14 February 2005 a written request from WAL's solicitors to the Authority to make a decision under s 111 of the Act concerning a condition of the 1620 licence, being that the site of that licence be changed from Manly to Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Critical to the present proceedings is the Authority's correspondence of 30 June 2005, which, after describing the relevant policies and expressing the effect of the proposed relocation on separation distances between the transmission under the 1620 licence and those nearby, was relevantly in the following terms:
 
 '...the [Authority] will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the [Act] and vary the licence conditions in the terms proposed by [WAL]... 
 
 [S]ection 111 confers a power on the [Authority] to unilaterally impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In this way, the only "decision" contemplated by the section is one that will some way change the licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">If there is no change to the licence conditions, then for section 111 purposes, no decision has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It follows from this that it is only where the [Authority] decides to impose, revoke or vary conditions that a review can be sought under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 
 In this case the [Authority] has not made a decision to change the licence conditions so a reviewable decision has not been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">' 
 

The first issue arising in the present interlocutory dispute is whether that communication was a decision ... made... under an enactment for the purposes of s 3(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It is that issue which is addressed by these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 

15 WAL subsequently requested reconsideration of the Authority's refusal to vary the licence site condition, doing so purportedly pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">WAL also sought from the Authority a statement of its reasons for decision pursuant to s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Both of those requests were refused by the Authority in correspondence of 18 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In that correspondence, the Authority reiterated its view that 
 
 '...section 111 of the Act confers a power on [the Authority] to impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">[The Authority] has not exercised its power under section 111 to impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">There is therefore no decision under the Act for [the Authority] to reconsider under section 285 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">' 

In respect of WAL's request for a statement of reasons, the Authority said:
 
 'the decision not to vary the licence condition of [the 1620 licence] is not a decision made under the [Act].</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The [ADJR Act] applies to decisions made under an enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">As there has not been any such decision, this request for a statement of reasons is refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">' 
 

16 It is further in issue in the present interlocutory proceedings whether the Authority's refusal to reconsider its decision pursuant to s 285 of the Act, and to provide a statement of reasons for its decision of 30 June 2005, amounted to decision[s] ... made ... under an enactment for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The applicants' reasons for the intervention of curial relief and the nature of the relief sought 
 
17 It is largely in the context I have already described that what the applicants contend to have been the primary decision of the Authority made adversely to the applicants on 30 June 2005, being a decision followed by the Authority's subsequent refusal to reconsider that earlier decision pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act, or to provide reasons for it, have become the subject of an application for review under both the ADJR Act, and contemporaneously also under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (' Judiciary Act ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The applicants' apprehension is that the practical effect of the decisions of the Authority under review is that their present broadcasting service under the auspices of the 1620 licence must cease to be provided to the Brisbane area, there being apparently no other means by which the applicants could cause their subject broadcasting service to be transmitted to the numbers of persons in that area presently reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The implications of any such outcome are apparently considered to be as damaging as they are far reaching to the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">18 The applicants' case was that the maintenance of the status quo in relation to the 1620 licence, is vital to WAL's business involving the sale of broadcast airtime to advertisers, and further that the metropolitan area of Brisbane, as the capital city of Queensland, is a vital part of WAL's radio network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The provision of the subject broadcasting service under the 1620 licence is a key source of the advertising revenue of WAL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">That is because when allocating advertising to radio networks, advertising agencies place significant weight on the ability of a network to reach audiences in the three major Eastern seaboard capital cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Accordingly if WAL is unable to continue to provide a radio network which covers each of those cities, it will be seriously disadvantaged financially when competing in the national radio market, being a market presently embracing at least those three capital cities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It was asserted that WAL's reputation as a reliable provider of national commercial radio would therefore also be greatly damaged, with a consequentially adverse impact on all remaining markets in which it presently operates, and therefore on its revenues, share price and returns to shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">19 The Authority's decision primarily the subject of the present application for review, as I have foreshadowed, was communicated to the applicants by letter dated 30 June 2005, being a decision by the Authority not to vary a condition of the 1620 licence by providing that instead of the site of transmission remaining nominally at 170 Kingsley Terrace, Manly, the current site of actual transmission at 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa be authorised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">That nominated site relocation was not entertained because it was said not to meet the Authority's policy relating to separation distances between transmitters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">That refusal of site relocation decision, according to the applicants, was made pursuant to s 111 of the Act; however the Authority did not so characterise the same, and hence the Authority did not issue a s 287 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">20 Included within the challenge of that decision of 30 June 2005, and hence the subject further of the present administrative review proceedings, are also what the applicants term the Authority's subsequent decisions, each made on 18 August 2005, being not to reconsider its first decision pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act, and also to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons for that first decision pursuant to s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The Authority adopted the position that no decision the subject of challenge had been made by it under an enactment, notwithstanding, as the applicants would insist, that a decision of the Authority exercising the discretion conferred by s 111 of the Act would constitute such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">21 The basis provided by the applicants in their amended application for being 'aggrieved' by the three respective decisions referred to above, within the meaning of s 5(1) of the ADJR Act, were outlined as follows: 
 
 
 (i) AusCoast is a wholly owned subsidiary of WAL and the holder of the 1620 licence; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) by letter dated 14 February 2005, WAL requested that the site of the 1620 licence be changed from the Manly site to the Tingalpa site; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the Authority 'claims that no decision has been made under an enactment and has refused to reconsider the First Decision [ie communicated on 30 June 2005] or to provide a statement of reasons as sought by [WAL].</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">' 
 
 
 

22 The grounds for the applicants' review application were fourfold as follows:
 
 
 (i) the first decision of the Authority on 30 June 2005 involved one or more errors of law, in that: 
 

(a) the Authority misconstrued the NAS PIP Policy (being the policy embodying the so-called '30/160 rule' and the 'make it better rule') by applying the same as if it had the force of law; 
 
(b) the first decision was made in accordance with that policy, being a published policy of the Authority, and was based primarily on the reduction in distance between another radiocommunications transmission site at Mango Hill (apparently conducted by Proma Radio) and the Tingalpa site from 30.7 kilometres to 29.6 kilometres; so much was said by the applicants to involve 'an overly rigid application of the policy, which is a policy and not a statutory rule';
 
 
 (ii) the making of the first decision on 30 June 2005 was an improper exercise of the power conferred by s 111 of the Act, in pursuance of which it was purported to be made, in that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the Authority failed to take relevant considerations into account in the exercise of the power, namely the considerations set out in WAL's request for the site of the licence to be changed from Manly to Tingalpa; 
 (b) the Authority exercised its discretionary power in accordance with a rule of policy without regard to the merits of the particular case; 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the second decision, being the Authority's refusal to reconsider its decision of 30 June 2005, involved an error of law, in that the Authority misconstrued ss 111, 285(f) and 285(g) of the Act;
 (iv) the third decision involved an error of law, in that having regard to the proper construction of ss 111, 285(f) and 285(g) of the Act, the Authority was obliged under s 13 of the ADJR Act to provide WAL with a statement of reasons under that provision in respect of the first decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">
 

23 Those above respective provisions of the Act (of course being the Radiocommunications Act 1992 (Cth) earlier referred to) read, so far as presently material, as follows:
 
 '111 Changes to licence conditions 
 
 
 
 (i) The ACMA may, by notice in writing given to the licensee of an apparatus licence: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) impose one or more further conditions to which the licence is subject; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) revoke or vary any condition imposed under paragraph (a); or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) revoke or vary any condition specified under paragraph 107(1)(g) ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) if the licence is a transmitter licence, other than a licence issued under section 101A , 102 or 102A or a datacasting transmitter licence --- vary a condition of the kind referred to in paragraph 108(2)(a), (b) or (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">' 
 
 
 
 

(I would mention that s 107 relates to general conditions of an apparatus licence, s 108 to additional conditions for transmitter licences, and ss 101A , 102 and 102A to transmitter licences for particular broadcasting services).</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">
 
 '285 Decisions that may be subject to reconsideration by the ACMA 
 
 
 
 An application may be made to the ACMA for reconsideration of any of the following decisions: 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (f) inclusion of conditions in an apparatus licence under paragraph 107 (1)(g) ...; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (g) a decision under section 111 concerning the conditions of an apparatus licence;'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 
 
 
 

24 It is appropriate to set out also the text of paragraphs 107(1)(a), (f) and (g):
 
 '107 General conditions 
 
 
 
 (1) An apparatus licence is subject to the following conditions: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a condition that the licensee, and any person authorised by the licensee to operate a radiocommunications device under the licence, must comply with this Act; 
 
 ... 
 
 (f) such conditions (if any) as the ACMA may determine, by written instrument, in relation to that particular type of apparatus licence; 
 
 (g) such other conditions as are specified in the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 ...' 
 
 The Authority's objections to competency and the applicants' contentions in support of competency 
 
25 On 31 August 2005, the Authority filed an amended notice of objection to competency which asserted that the Court lacked jurisdiction to try the application for review brought under the ADJR Act and under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , on the grounds that the decision purportedly the subject of the proceedings is not a decision made under an enactment nor a matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The amended notice of objection to competency went on to state '[i]n the alternative if the court determines that it has jurisdiction there is no proper basis upon which to grant relief to the applicant[s]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The Authority described this as its 'related alternative motion'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">26 As I have foreshadowed, in support of its objection to competency, in relation to the operation of the ADJR Act in the present circumstances outlined by the applicants, the Authority characterised its decision of 30 June 2005 adversely to the applicants, not as a decision to refuse to change the subject site condition for the 1620 licence of the applicants, but rather as a prior decision to decline to consider whether or not the site condition may be varied at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It was largely upon that footing that the Authority contended that the initial or prior decision of 30 June 2005 was not a decision made under an enactment, even though a decision involving the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 111 of the Act would seemingly constitute such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The applicants rejoined to the effect that even if that purported distinction was to be taken at face value, the very notion that any such so-called initial or prior decision did not constitute a decision made under the Act immediately encounters forensic and conceptual difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The Authority also submitted that the lawfulness of such initial or prior decision was not a ' matter ... arising under any laws made by the Parliament ...' (see s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act ), since it was made under a non-legislative policy, being the subject of the NAS PIP and NAS BOP policy documents referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">27 The meaning and implications of the statutory notion of 'decision', where used in the ADJR Act, was comprehensively explained by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It was emphasised by Mason CJ at 335 (with whose reasons Brennan J agreed, as did Deane J other than in relation to a particular matter not here material) that such meaning must be determined by reference to the text, scope and purpose of the legislation, and further that the remedial nature of the ADJR Act indicates that no narrow view is to be taken of the notion of 'decision' in that statutory context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Moreover his Honour pointed out at 336 that the concept of 'a reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorises, rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision', and further that 'the examples of a decision listed in the extended definition contained in s 3(2) [of the ADJR Act] are also indicative of a decision having the character or quality of finality, [being] an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application, inquiry or dispute ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Section 3(3) of the ADJR Act, which extends the statutory definition of 'decision' to '... the making of a report or recommendation before a decision is made in the exercise of a power ', was said by his Honour to operate to '... qualif[y] the characteristic of finality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Moreover the Chief Justice explained that '... acts done preparatory to the making of a "decision" are not to be regarded as constituting "decisions" for, if they were, there would be little, if any, point in providing for judicial review of "conduct" as well as of a "decision".</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">'
 
28 In the further course of his reasons for judgment in Bond at 337, Mason CJ pointed out that '... a reviewable "decision" is one for which provision is made by or under a statute', which '... will generally, but not always, entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration', so long of course '... that it be a substantive determination', as opposed to 'procedural determinations'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">29 The applicants focused those explanations and expositions of the Chief Justice upon s 111 of the Act, which refers to power conferred upon the Authority inter alia to revoke or vary any condition of a licence which it may have previously imposed, and submitted that so much did not mean that a refusal to exercise any such positive power on the part of the Authority did not constitute a decision made under s 111.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">It was pointed out in that regard, in my opinion rightly, that there are many statutes in which the decision-making power is expressed only in terms of a positive discretion, without express reference to the power to make a decision of a negative character, yet in such cases it is necessarily implicit that a negative decision would also be made under that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Otherwise, so it was further emphasised by the present applicants, paras (a), (b) and (g) of s 3(2) of the ADJR Act would be otiose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Those subsections read as follows (the emphasis appearing in non-italics is mine):
 
 's 3(2) In this Act, a reference to the making of a decision includes a reference to: 
 
 
 
 (a) making, suspending, revoking or refusing to make an order, award or determination; 
 (b) giving, suspending, revoking or refusing to give a certificate, direction, approval, consent or permission; 
 
 
 ... 
 (g) doing or refusing to do any other act or thing...' 
 

30 In that context of the applicants' discussion of general principles and their operation, I was then referred to the decision of a Full Federal Court in Right to Life Association (NSW) Inc v Secretary, Department of Human Services and Health (1995) 56 FCR 50, where it was held by Lockhart and Beaumont JJ that a decision by the Secretary not to direct that clinical trials of a drug be stopped was a reviewable decision for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The provision in issue was item 3(e) of Schedule 5A of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 (Cth), that item being one of a number of conditions to be satisfied for exemption of the drug from the operation of Part 3 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth), which condition read as follows:
 
 '(e) the Secretary must not, at any time: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) have become aware that to conduct or continue the trial would be contrary to the public interest; and 
 
 (ii) have directed that the trial not be conducted, or be stopped ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 
 
 

The appellant Association had requested the Secretary to stop the trials on the ground that they amounted to a breach of NSW and Victorian criminal law, and were thus ' contrary to the public interest '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The Secretary had then notified the appellant Association and advised that on the evidence available, 'nothing would warrant my acting to stop the trials'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">At 62, Lockhart J observed in relation to that notification as follows:
 
 
 'If the Secretary has reached the opposite conclusion, namely, that to continue the trials would be contrary to the public interest and that a direction should be given to stop them, and thereupon gave that direction, surely that must be a reviewable decision under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The sponsor [of the trial] would clearly be a person aggrieved and would in my view be entitled to such a review of the decision under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Why should the position be different if the Secretary reaches the opposite conclusion, as he did in this case ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">It was a decision which had "the character or quality of finality"; it was an ultimate or operative decision ...' 
 

Beaumont J, who reached the same decision as Lockhart J, pointed out at 80 that '... the definition of "decision" in s 3(1) of the ADJR Act is not confined to those cases where a duty to make a decision is imposed ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Although he reached a different outcome to the majority, Gummow J's observations at 88 are I think also apposite for consideration in the present circumstances:
 
 
 'It was submitted for the Secretary that s 5(1) of the ADJR Act would be attracted only if conferral of the power to give the direction carried with it a duty upon the Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It was then submitted that in the case of condition (e) there was no such duty ... 
 
 The submission, in essence, would limit the operation of s 5 of the ADJR Act to decisions in respect of which there was a public duty, performance of which might be required by a writ of mandamus ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">This would be contrary to the scheme of the legislation ...' 
 

31 The Authority sought to deny any conclusion as to the existence of a justiciable decision by characterising its first decision as declining to even consider the exercise of any discretion under s 111 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">In the applicants' submission that purported characterisation was misconceived, and must be rejected, for the following reasons:
 
 
 (i) the decision not to exercise its power under s 111 to vary a condition of the licence was indeed final, operative and determinative, in the practical sense described in Bond and in Right to Life [cedilla] of AusCoast's ability to continue to broadcast under the auspices of the 1620 licence from the current site at Tingalpa;
 
 (ii) any such characterisation sits at least uncomfortably with the terms of the Authority's letter of 30 June 2005, containing as it does the assertion '[a]s a result the [Authority] will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the [Act] and vary licence conditions in the terms proposed by [WAL]'; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the decision not to exercise the power was one which was authorised by and therefore made under s 111 of the Act, since s 111 confers a discretionary power, and hence contemplates that a decision whether or not to exercise that discretion could be made, there being no other source of power for such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">
 
 
 

I think that there is force in each of the foregoing submissions of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">
 

32 The Authority did not dispute that a refusal to exercise a power may constitute a decision...made...under an enactment , for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Nevertheless it sought to distinguish Right to Life on the basis that in the circumstances of that case, as opposed to the present case, the decision-maker had purported to consider 'the full gamut...of all the relevant issues'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The Authority's contention was that its officer in this instance had in effect 'terminated the request [made by WAL for a variation in the site condition of the 1620 licence] at the first hurdle', without considering all of the issues that the Authority would normally take into account in assessing a variation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">I am not persuaded that such contention of the Authority is sound, and that there is in any event any viable difference between the circumstances relevantly in Right to Life and those here prevailing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">In both instances the decision-maker received a request for a decision to be made to a certain effect, and in both instances there was no provision made under the relevant legislation for such requests to be made by formal application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Moreover in both cases, detailed reasons for that request were given by the entity in favour of the decision it sought to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Most importantly for the outcome of this objection to competency, it was put by the applicants that the refusal of the Authority to make a decision in the terms requested by WAL had the practical effect of constituting an ultimate or operative decision, and hence one which bore the character of finality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The applicants' contentions in relation to what it termed the Authority's second decision made on 18 August 2005 
 
33 It becomes necessary to consider next the implications of the Authority's so-called 'second decision', being that said by the applicants to have been made on 18 August 2005 not to reconsider its first decision of 30 June 2005, to the effect that it would not exercise its discretionary statutory power to alter the condition on the 1620 licence so as to change the site of the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The Authority's objection to the Court's competency to review the second decision rested however on its objection to competency of review of the first decision, and was therefore said by the applicants to encounter the same or similar difficulties which I have already described in relation to the first decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The applicants contended that '[t]he plain words of para 285(g) [of the Act] also tell against the [Authority]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">34 The opening words to s 285, which I have of course already extracted, but nevertheless merit further emphasis, are that ' [a]n application may be made to [the Authority] for reconsideration of any of the following decisions ', the notion of reconsideration being of wide import.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Moreover the ensuing language of sub-paragraph (g) includes the word concerning , which was also said by the applicants to be of wide import, such that there could be no contextual reason to construe s 285(g) narrowly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Hence the applicants contended on that basis that the Authority's decision not to vary the site condition at the centre of the disputation was clearly a decision concerning the conditions of the 1620 licence, that licence being of course an apparatus licence .</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">35 It was submitted by the applicants moreover that the wording of s 285(g) of the Act should be compared with other sub-paragraphs of s 285.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">I was referred again to s 285(f) which explicitly refers to the inclusion of conditions in an apparatus licence under paragraph 107(1)(g) ...' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">So much was said by the applicants 'clearly' to exclude review of a negative decision, that is to say, a decision not to includ[e] the operation of any conditions in an apparatus licence under s 107(1)(g), which statutory expression is used in marked contrast to what appears in s 285(g), which was described by the applicants as covering 'both positive and negative decisions' by reason of its use in particular of the broad notion of concerning .</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">36 It was further submitted by the applicants that if s 285(g) of the Act was intended to be limited to decisions to give a notice under s 111, the Legislature would have used an expression such as that used in s 285(qa), namely decisions giving a notice .</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The point was said moreover to be made even more starkly when other sections of the Act are considered, such as s 118, which by para (a) of subs (1) thereof refers to 'a notice under section 111 relating to changes in licence conditions ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The applicants submitted that it would have been a simple matter for the draftsperson to have used that expression in s 285(g) of the Act, had so much been the legislative intention, and further that the difference in expression provided an indication that para 285(g) has a wider operation than the phrase used in s 118(1)(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">There is considerable force in those submissions of the applicants upon the statutory texts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Outline of the Authority's submissions in support of its objection to competency 
 
37 The Authority's principal contention was that the Act did not impose any duty upon it to consider or act upon requests made by licensees or others to vary the conditions of apparatus licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Instead s 111 of the Act reposed in the Authority a discretionary power to unilaterally vary or revoke conditions of apparatus licences, and s 111 did not provide for a means whereby a licensee could move the Authority to exercise its power under that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The Act was said by the Authority to draw 'a clear distinction' between 'powers in respect of which an application may be made and is necessary and those where no provision is made for an application from an interested person'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">I was referred in that regard to s 286 of the Act, which was said to evidence the former situation, that section reading as follows:
 
 
 's 286 Deadlines for reaching certain decisions 
 
 (1) If this Act provides for a person to make an application to the ACMA for such a decision, the ACMA must make the decision: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) within 90 days after receiving the application; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if the ACMA has, within those 90 days, given the applicant a written request for further information about the application --- within 90 days after receiving that further information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">' 
 
 
 
 

Subsection (2) provides for a deemed refusal by the Authority, if it has not informed an applicant of its decision within 90 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Where any such application procedure is invoked, it was acknowledged by the Authority that it '... is under a duty to consider the application and indeed, must do so within a prescribed timeframe'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">
 

38 Section 286 appears in Part 5.6 of the Act entitled 'Review of decisions' and follows s 285, which provides for the making of applications to the Authority for reconsideration of the decisions listed in that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Bearing in mind the location of s 286 within Part 5.6 of the Act, the meaning of ' application...for such a decision ' in s 286 must be read as a reference to an application to the Authority for a reconsideration under s 285, and not as a reference generally to any decision of the Authority under the Act for which application can be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In any event, the absence of any such express 'application procedures' under the Act for the making by the Authority of decisions under s 111 was said by the Authority to imply that it lacked a duty to consider any request or application purportedly made by a licensee under s 111.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">I observe that the Authority did not draw the Court's attention to any species of decision under the Act for which an application procedure exists other than to applications for reconsideration of the decisions listed in s 285.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">39 The Authority next contended that where no application procedure is provided for, as was said to be the case with decisions made under s 111, the Authority may have a discretionary power that can be exercised, such as its power to vary conditions under s 111, but that the Authority would be under no duty to exercise that power, or even to consider whether or not to exercise that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Reference was made to two Full Federal Court authorities relating to the operation of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (' Migration Act '), as exemplifications of what was said to be a general principle that the mere existence of a discretionary power does not carry with it a duty to exercise the power, or even to consider whether or not to exercise the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">40 It is convenient to consider immediately whether either of those authorities do exemplify or otherwise lend support to that contention of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">WAGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 227 was concerned with the operation of s 427(1)(d) of the Migration Act , which provided that the Refugee Review Tribunal ('RRT') '... may require the Secretary to arrange for the making of any investigation ... that the Tribunal thinks necessary with respect to the review .</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">' The Full Court in WAGJ (Heerey, RD Nicholson and Mansfield JJ) held that s 427(1)(d) did not impose a duty upon the RRT to consider whether to exercise that power to order an investigation, their Honours placing emphasis upon such statutory words may and Tribunal thinks necessary .</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">I would observe that the Court in WAGJ did not purport to lay down any general principle or rule, their Honours' decision apparently being predicated on the above emphasised words in s 427(1)(d) , and the prevailing legislative context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The issue arising relevantly in the second of those decisions relied upon by the Authority, being WAJQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 79 , was not concerned with any particular provision of the Migration Act at all, the appellant in that litigation contending that the Tribunal had erred by failing to enquire into the veracity of certain documents and correspondence provided by the appellant in support of his application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">It is not apparent that the appellant in WAJQ formulated his case by reference to the operation of s 427(1)(d) of that legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The Full Court cited WAGJ as authority for the wider proposition that there is no duty on the RRT to make inquiries, the failure to carry out whereof would give rise to judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">41 I am unable to obtain sufficient assistance from resort to authorities arising in the context of the Migration Act , which has its own terms and conditions for administrative review far removed from those contained in the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Leaving aside contextual statutory differences, WAGJ and WAJQ do not purport to lay down any principle of general application to the effect that the existence of a discretionary power does not impute a duty to consider whether or not to exercise it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Nor was either of WAGJ or WAJQ concerned with the meaning of ' decision ... made ... under an enactment ', as that expression appears in the ADJR Act, or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">42 It was the Authority's further contention that its officers paid due regard to policy formulated by the Authority concerning the location of MF NAS transmitters, and took the view, as they were said by the Authority to be entitled to do, that the proposed relocation advanced by the applicants did not meet the policy requirements apparent in the so-called '30/160 rule', or the 'make it a better rule' apparent in the NAS PIP policy, and that as a consequence, it was decided by the Authority that the applicants' proposal should not be further entertained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The circumstances of the present case were said by the Authority in that context to be 'broadly analogous' to those considered in a joint judgment of a Full Federal Court (comprising Black CJ, Kiefel and Emmett JJ) in Bedlington v Chong (1998) 87 FCR 75, which was concerned with the operation of ss 48A and 48B of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The Authority relied upon Bedlington for the proposition that it is open to a decision-maker, who is under no duty to consider exercising a discretionary power, to draft a policy which identifies the types of cases in which the exercise of that discretion might be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">43 Again I am unable to obtain sufficient assistance from resort to authorities involving the application and operation of the Migration Act , which in the case of Bedlington explicitly stipulated that ' the Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the [power] ... in any ... circumstances '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The Full Court emphasised at 78 of its reasons for judgment that the particular language of subsection 48B(6) was the sole basis for their decision that the Minister was under no duty in any circumstances to exercise the relevant power under s 48B(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">The critical issue arising was whether the Departmental Secretary was under a duty to bring the application made for the exercise of the power under s 48B(1) to the Minister's attention in order that the Minister could personally determine whether or not to exercise that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Their Honours held that the use of policy guidelines by the Secretary as the basis for refusing to bring the application to the Minister's attention, where such guidelines were specifically intended to identify those cases in which the Minister might consider the exercise of his or her power was valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">I have considerable difficulty in discerning the availability of assistance from that further authority, given that it relevantly involved a power that the provision required be exercised personally by the Minister, and concerned only the proposition that the Minister had no statutory obligation to make a decision, and again did not occur in an ADJR Act context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Moreover there is no express provision in the Act (ie the legislation the subject of the present proceedings) to the effect that the Authority need not make any relevant decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">All that discourse put forward by the Authority here in relation to migration cases, in any event, ultimately still begs the question as to whether a decision not to make a decision in a particular context nevertheless constitutes a decision ... made... under an enactment within s 5 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Taken to their logical conclusion, the Authority's submissions appear moreover to run contrary to the warning issued by Gummow J in Right to Life , which I have extracted above, to the effect that limiting the scope of the ADJR Act to decisions in respect of which there was a duty, performance of which might be required by a writ of mandamus would be contrary to the scheme of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">In that latter regard, I would refer again to the text of s 3(2) of the ADJR Act earlier extracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">44 In further support of the contention that a decision by an officer to the effect that a request does not fall within an established policy as to which decisions will or will not be entertained, is not a decision...made...under an enactment , the Authority referred me to two additional decisions of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The first was Brownsville Nominees Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 169, where Northrop J held that the Commissioner's refusal to issue an amended assessment under s 170 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) was not subject to review under s 7 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Section 7(1) of the ADJR Act provides for the making of applications for review of the failure of a decision-maker to make a decision where, inter alia , that decision-maker has a duty to make a decision to which [the ADJR Act] applies .</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Northrop J held at 173 of his reasons for judgment that s 170 did not impose any duty on the Commissioner to make an amended assessment of income tax upon the request of a taxpayer, and thus the application for review of the Commissioner's refusal to issue the amended assessment was not competent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">I would observe that the Commissioner's refusal to issue an amended assessment was expressed to the taxpayer in that case in the following terms (at 171):
 
 '...In the circumstances your request to have the subject assessments amended should remain in abeyance pending resolution of the appeal...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">
 

Of course the issue thus arising fell for consideration in the context of the complexity of the code of that legislation as to the circumstances where an amendment to an assessment may be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Brownsville Nominees did not involve the situation of a successful challenge to an assessment of tax by the Australian Tax Office made by a taxpayer, whether formally or informally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The Authority contended nevertheless that there was no practical difference between that situation and the present, the Authority simply deciding here not to consider the request for a variation at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">
 

45 It is important to bear in mind, in any event, that the applicants have applied for review of the Authority's decision here under s 5(1) of the ADJR Act, and not under s 7 thereof, so that the only question with which I am presently concerned is whether or not the subject decision fulfilled the requirements of s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">In that context I would observe what Lockhart J said at 62 of his reasons for judgment in Right to Life concerning Brownsville Nominees :
 
 'We were referred by counsel for the Secretary to the judgment of Northrop J in [ Brownsville Nominees ] as authority for the proposition that there was no "decision" within the meaning of s 5 of the ADJR Act because there was no duty imposed on the Secretary to make such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Brownsville is not authority for that proposition...His Honour's decision was based squarely upon the duties imposed upon the Commissioner under the Assessment Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">' 
 

In similarly rejecting the application of Brownsville Nominees in the manner sought by the Secretary, Beaumont J concluded at 80 of his reasons for judgment that:
 
 'I have difficulty accepting the submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">In the first place, as has been noted, the definition of "decision" in s 3(1) of the ADJR Act is not confined to those cases where a duty to make a decision is imposed, although such decisions are also picked up...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">
 

Moreover at 88 of his reasons for judgment, Gummow J expressed his agreement with:
 
 '...what [was] said in the reasons for judgment of the other members of the Court as to the inadequacy of [ Brownsville Nominees ] as authority for the proposition that in the present case there could be no decision attracting the ADJR Act unless the Secretary was under a duty to act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">' 
 

I need add nothing further as to the absence of any assistance of Brownsville to the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">46 A further authority referred to by counsel for the Authority in the course of argument was Carter v Minister for Aboriginal Affairs [2005] FCA 667.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In that case, Ryan J held, inter alia , that the Minister's refusal to exercise his power under s 21D(2) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) to make a temporary declaration of preservation was not a decision for the purposes of s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">47 Subsections 21D(1) and (2) of that particular legislation were in the following terms: 
 
 
 '(1) If a local Aboriginal community decides, whether after an application is made to it or on its own motion, that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a place or object in the community area is an Aboriginal place or Aboriginal object; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) that place or object is under threat of injury or desecration; 
 
 
 
 
 
 the community may advise the Minister that it considers a temporary declaration of preservation should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) On receiving advice under subsection (1) or determining on his or her own motion that a temporary declaration of preservation should be made, the Minister: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) shall, within 14 days, cause notice of the advice or determination to be given to any person who is likely to be affected by the making of a declaration; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) shall give any such person an opportunity to be heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">' 
 
 
 

48 Ryan J found that the Minister there had not received advice from a local Aboriginal community in accordance with s 21D(1), and thus the issue of relevance was whether or not the Minister's decision not to determine[e] on his...own motion that a temporary declaration of preservation should be made was a reviewable decision for the purposes of s 5(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The Minister had informed the applicants in writing that he would 'consider' their request for a determination on his own motion, but later told the applicants that he would not do so pending the resolution of another proceeding before this Court involving the same artefacts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">His Honour found that the Minister's decision was a decision to decline to determine[e]...on his own motion and was thus made 'preparatory' to the making of a decision to determine to make a temporary declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Alternatively, his Honour characterised the decision declining to so determine[e] as 'a conclusion reached as a step on the way to an ultimate decision', which is not reviewable, for that reason also, thereby referring to dicta to like effect at 337 of Mason CJ's reasons for judgment in Bond .</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">49 The applicants submitted, in my opinion correctly, that the particular statutory framework addressed in Carter featured a 'staged process of decision-making' whereby before making the ultimate decision of imposing a temporary declaration of preservation , the Minister may make a decision to proceed with such a determination on his or her own motion, such a decision being clearly 'a step along the way'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">By contrast the present legislation (ie the Radiocommunications Act ) features no such stepped or staged decision-making, the power to make the ultimate or operative decision being conferred in its terms by s 111 and relevantly, s 111(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">On that basis at least, Carter is distinguishable from the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">50 The Authority submitted next that a similar conclusion to that which it advocated here was reached by an application of the principles stated by the High Court in Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 213 ALR 724.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The issue there arising was whether the decision of a university to exclude a candidate for a doctorate of philosophy on account of academic misconduct was made under an enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">In a majority finding to the contrary of that candidate's complaint, the following appears at [89] in the joint reasons for judgment of Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ to the negative of that proposition (their Honours' emphasis appears in non-italics):
 
 'The determination of whether a decision is "made... under an enactment" involves two criteria: first, the decision must be expressly or impliedly required or authorised by the enactment; and, secondly, the decision must itself confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, and in that sense the decision must derive from the enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">A decision will only be "made... under an enactment" if both these criteria are met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">It should be emphasised that this construction of the statutory definition does not require the relevant decision to affect or alter existing rights or obligations, and it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Similarly, it is not necessary that the relevantly affected legal rights owe their existence to the enactment in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Affection of rights or obligations derived from the general law or statute will suffice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">' 
 

Purportedly in the light of that dicta , the Authority contended that its '... decision not to entertain [WAL's] request, however it be characterised, did not confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights', but '... left them precisely as they were before the applicants requested the [Authority] to exercise its non-compellable discretionary power'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Even if that analysis of the Authority be correct in terms of the present circumstances of either one or both of the applicants, notwithstanding implications flowing historically from their enjoyment of transmission from the Tingalpa site, it is an analysis which in any event appears to fall short of the foregoing dicta in Griffith University that '... it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">I would add that counsel for the Authority conceded during the hearing that Griffith University would be of no assistance to him if I were to find that the Authority had in fact exercised its power under s 111 , as opposed to merely declining to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">At least the Authority's communications with the applicants in 2004 point to the former of those propositions as being the case, as do the Authority's file notes of the same year, as is I think sufficiently apparent from what I have earlier extracted therefrom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">
 

51 The submissions of the respondent Authority sought to conclude that '[f]or all of these reasons, the decision of the [Authority's] officers was not a decision under an enactment', and was '... not, therefore, a decision to which the [ADJR Act] applies ... [and] [s]imilarly, the lawfulness of the decision is not a matter arising under a law of the Parliament if it were made under a non-legislative policy'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The Authority did not elaborate on that latter submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">However it is clear that it was predicated on the Authority's construction of its decision that was contended by the applicants to be 'highly technical' and 'prefer[ring] form over substance, contrary to the remedial character of the ADJR Act'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">In essence, as I have foreshadowed already, the respondent Authority contended that the 'decision' was nothing more than the refusal of its own officers to consider whether to exercise the Authority's power under s 111 of the Act, that determination having been made by the relevant officers by reference to the policies of the Authority encapsulated in NAS PIP and NAS BOP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">52 The Authority accepted that '... this Court has jurisdiction under s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act to determine whether the [Authority] was under a duty to consider the applicants' request to vary [AusCoast's] licence condition', but asserted that '[n]onetheless, if this Court accepts that the [Authority] was not under such a duty (and remains free from such a duty), the Court would be unable to make an order in the nature of mandamus'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Absent such an order, so the Authority further submitted, there was no proper basis for any of the relief sought by the applicants', thereby citing Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Applicants S134/2002 (2003) 211 CLR 411 at [44]-[48] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) and at [98]-[100] (Gaudron and Kirby JJ), in each such instance containing observations relating to the operation of s 417(1) of the Migration Act , whereby the Minister is empowered to substitute for the RRT's decision a decision more favourable to an applicant for relief, if ' ... the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Once again I have difficulty in identifying any sufficiency of assistance of authority from a context involving quite different legislation; indeed s 417(7) of the Migration Act at least then explicitly stipulated that ' [t]he Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (1) in respect of any decision, whether he or she is requested to do so by the applicant or by any other person, or in any other circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">' In any event, as the applicants rightly pointed out, whether or not mandamus might be available against the Authority in relation to the operation of s 111 of the Act, relief pursuant to s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act for declaratory relief was sought by the applicants' amended application which Jacobson J accepted for filing in Court on 25 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">I have of course earlier referred to the applicants' case for relief being framed on that basis by way of additional or alternative relief to that afforded by the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">53 As to what the Authority referred to as its 'related alternative motion', the Authority contended that since AusCoast is currently broadcasting from premises which are not the premises specified on the conditions of its licence, such conduct was unlawful and improper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Accordingly, in case the Court was otherwise minded to entertain a grant of relief following a substantive hearing, it was submitted that relief should be refused as a matter of discretion; since the applicants here seek to protect and validate unlawful and improper conduct, and thereby attract the operation of the maxim of equity 'he who comes into equity must come with clean hands', discussed in R Meagher, D Heydon and M Leeming, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines &amp; Remedies , (4 th ed) at [3-110].</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The relief presently sought by the applicants is however in the nature of administrative and not equitable relief, the applicants having not purportedly founded any case on equitable estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">In any event I am of course presently concerned with the Authority's notice of objection to competency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The relevance of any such matters so raised by the Authority is limited to the Court's determination of final relief, should the Authority's objection to competency fail wholly or in part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">54 I should add for completeness that in a short supplementary submission, the Authority repeated the essence of its earlier submissions, and submitted further in the alternative as follows ( inter alia ):
 
 'If the court accepts that there is no duty [for the Authority to consider a request made for a variation of an apparatus licence under s 111] but considers that, nonetheless, the Authority made a decision under s 111, the matter would need to go to a substantive hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">There would then be an argument about whether a reviewable error was made in that legislative context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">There would also be a discretionary issue too.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">' 
 

It is sufficient for me to respond to that supplementary submission at the present stage of the proceedings by referring to the interlocutory decision upon which I have arrived below in the light of the respective submissions of the parties, which have been addressed on the basis of the Authority's objection to competency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Conclusions 
 
55 I am of the opinion that the Authority's objection to competency in its presently amended form must be dismissed, for reasons which I have largely foreshadowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">56 The applicants have rightly contended that the following decisions of the respondent Authority are reviewable by the Court under and pursuant to the provisions of the ADJR Act:
 
 
 (i) the decision of the Authority made on 30 June 2005 under s 111 of the Act not to exercise its power to change the condition on its radiocommunications apparatus licence number 1130030 (called the 1620 licence) granted to AusCoast, such that the site for the operation of that licence be altered from 170 Kingsley Terrace Manly, Brisbane in the State of Queensland to 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa, Brisbane in that State ('the first decision'); 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) the further decision by the Authority made on 18 August 2005 not to reconsider the first decision under s 285(g) of the Act; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the further decision by the Authority also made on 18 August 2005 to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons for the first decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">
 
 
 

57 I am further of the opinion, to the extent that it may therefore matter, that in so far as the Authority has contended that the subject decisions of the Authority did not arise under any laws made by the Parliament pursuant to s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , that further contention must also fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">58 It will have been appreciated from observations that I have made in the course of my outline of these reasons for judgment that I would reject the contention of the Authority that its decision-making of 30 June 2005 merely constituted a withholding from consideration of a request of either or both of the applicants to change the site condition of the 1620 licence, whether pursuant to an exercise of a discretionary function or power generally or at large on the Authority's part, or otherwise, and in particular whether by way of exercise of a discretionary power conferred under s 111 of the Act, or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The applicants, or at least WAL on behalf of both of them, in substance and in reality, applied unambiguously to the Authority on 6 August 2004 to change the site condition for the subject apparatus licence being a change which the Authority was empowered to implement pursuant to s 111 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">A statutory decision-maker does not avoid the operation of the review provisions of the ADJR Act by purporting to create, whether explicitly or implicitly, a standpoint or position involving a decliner of entry upon statutory decision-making, or for that matter of consideration of decision-making unless the statutory scheme for decision-making so provides (cf Carter ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">So much however is in reality the position or standpoint which the Authority has seemingly endeavoured to adopt and maintain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">59 Thus by way of reflection of the dictum I have cited from Bond , the communications of the Authority as evidenced from the outset by its faxed response of 16 August 2004 to the applicants' application of 6 August 2004 and thereafter, inclusive of its critical communication to WAL of 30 June 1995, the Authority indicated to the applicants the position which it had adopted or taken as inherently and essentially indicative of decision-making on its part, the same having for instance the 'character or quality of finality', and constituting and involving 'an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application' within the scope of that dictum of Mason CJ in Bond I have earlier cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">That communication of the Authority constituted or involved a decision 'at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">It was 'a substantive determination' as opposed to a 'procedural determination', to adopt the Chief Justice's further dictum in Bond .</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">60 Moreover by way of reflection of dicta I have cited from Right to Life , and in particular from that of Lockhart J at 62, I would characterise the Authority's conduct culminating in its faxed response of 30 June 2005 as similarly indicative of a conclusion having been reached by the Authority in or to the effect of the first decision postulated in the applicants' amended application filed in Court on 25 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The Authority made thereby a decision under s 111 not to effect a variation to one of the conditions it had imposed on the 1620 licence pursuant to s 107(1)(g) of the Act, namely the condition stipulating the transmission site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The Authority's communication of 30 June 2005 constituted or involved moreover the very opposite or antithesis of the decision which the applicants had been seeking from the Authority, commencing from WAL's application of 6 August 2004 made to the Authority, being a decision the implications and consequences whereof clearly and in substance affected rights and obligations of the applicants concerning the 1620 licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">61 It follows in my opinion that the Authority's objection to competency must fail, at least for the reason that such objection is founded on the erroneous proposition that no decision has been relevantly made under an enactment, pursuant to s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Whilst that conclusion renders unnecessary any conclusion to be reached as to whether a matter relevantly arose under any law made by the Parliament for the purpose of the operation of s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , I am unable to identify any viable basis in favour of a negative response to that latter proposition of the applicants as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">It is moreover not accurate for the Authority to contend that its refusal was a decision made pursuant to a policy as opposed to an enactment, any resemblance here to the factual situation prevailing in Bedlington being merely chimerical, for the reasons that I have indicated above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">62 It follows from my foregoing conclusions that the Authority's refusal to vary the 1620 licence site condition involves a matter arising under a law made by Parliament of the Commonwealth, the legislative authority to make that decision being conferred by s 111 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Accordingly I would further find that the purported ground of objection pleaded by the Authority in the alternative, namely that '... there is no proper basis upon which to grant relief to the applicant', must also fail, owing to the availability at least of declaratory relief to the applicants for the reasons I have earlier explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">63 Accordingly the application for review of the first decision sought by the applicants' amended application filed in Court on 25 August 2005 must proceed to a final hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">64 It follows moreover, in the light of all of my foregoing findings, that the further applications to review the Authority's decision of 18 August 2005 not to reconsider its prior principal decision of 30 June 2005, and also the Authority's yet further decision made at the same time to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons in respect of the first decision, must also proceed to a final hearing, the first decision not being one excluded from the operation of s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">65 I should add for completeness that the further concluding contention raised by the Authority in any event to the effect that since AusCoast presently broadcasts from premises at Tingalpa which are not the premises specified in the conditions of the 1620 licence, being conduct asserted by the Authority to be 'unlawful and improper', the Court should as a matter of discretion refuse that relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">That subject must be a question for another day, and is irrelevant to the issue of competency per se for the reasons I have already indicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Doubtless on that further occasion, the applicants would seek to pursue in more detail the circumstances and implications of the conduct of the Authority relating to the variation of the site condition on the 1611 licence to the Bracken Ridge Reservoir transmission site, being a conceivable issue apparently to be raised by the applicants from which I would necessarily withhold from further comment at this interlocutory stage of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Whether that subject is in any event a matter for legitimate consideration in the context of the administrative relief sought by the applicants would be a matter for submission at that further hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">66 The Authority having failed on what has been analogous to a demurrer to the applicants' cause of action, I see no good reason in principle why the applicants should not have the benefit of an award of costs in their favour of and incidental to the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">67 The proceedings will be stood over to a date to be fixed by agreement by the parties, or by the Court in the event that no agreement is reached, for the purpose or making such declarations and orders as may be appropriate to give effect to these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">
 
 I certify that the preceding sixty-seven (67) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.</sentence>

 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This is an appeal, pursuant to s 44 of the Administration Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act'), from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by Mr P J Lindsay, Senior Member ('the Tribunal'), given on 18 January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The Tribunal's decision was recorded in the following terms:
 
 'The tribunal affirms the decision under review in relation to the inclusion of the sum of $1,228,500 in the applicant's assessable income for the year ended 30 June 1988, but in relation to penalty remits the matter to the respondent with the direction that the assessment for that income year be amended by remitting additional tax in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">' 
 

3 The Commissioner of Taxation ('the Commissioner') appeals from so much of the Tribunal's decision as remits the matter of additional tax to the Commissioner with the direction that such additional tax be remitted in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">4 The Commissioner, in his Amended Notice of Appeal, states that the following questions of law are raised on the appeal ---
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Whether the Tribunal exceeded the jurisdiction conferred on it by section 14ZZ of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 [(Cth) ('the Administration Act')] in purporting to direct the Applicant to remit in full additional tax imposed on the Respondent for the year ended 30 June 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The proper interpretation of sections 14ZQ and 14ZS of the [Administration Act] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Whether the Tribunal erred in law in purporting to direct the Applicant to remit additional tax in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">' 
 
 
 

5 The grounds of appeal are stated in the same document (at par 4) in the following terms:
 
 
 '4.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Tribunal erred in law in failing to hold that the Applicant's decision on objection refusing to remit additional tax imposed pursuant to sec 223 was an "ineligible income tax remission decision" under section 14ZS of the [Administration Act] and therefore not a "reviewable objection decision" for the purposes of section 14ZQ of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
 4.2 The Tribunal erred in law in purporting to direct the Applicant to remit the additional tax in full, in circumstances where there was no jurisdiction to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.3 The Tribunal should have held that the Applicant's decision refusing to remit the additional tax was not a "reviewable objection decision" within the meaning of section 14ZQ of the [Administration Act] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.4 In so far as the Tribunal purported to direct the Applicant to remit additional tax payable under either section 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 or Division 1 of Part IIA of the [Administration Act] , the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make such a direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.5 If, contrary to the grounds set out in paragraphs 4.1 to 4.4 above, the Tribunal did have jurisdiction to direct that additional tax be remitted in full, the Tribunal, in purporting to make such a direction, erred in law in taking into account an irrelevant consideration namely the Applicant's consent to the matter remaining in abeyance before the Tribunal pending finalisation of other proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">' 
 
 
 
 BACKGROUND 
 
6 On 24 June 1994, following an audit, the Commissioner issued the respondent taxpayer with an amended assessment of income tax for the year ended 30 June 1988 including in his assessable income for that year an amount of $1,228,500 received by him in respect of a certain large infrastructure project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Additional Tax for incorrect return, shown at label D of the notice of amended assessment, in the sum of $586,858.75, was also imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 The taxpayer, by his taxation agent, lodged an objection to the amended assessment by letter dated 5 July 1994, but the grounds were confined to the inclusion of the sum of $1,228,500 in his assessable income and did not put in issue the imposition of the additional tax of $586,858.75.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 By letter dated 16 February 1996 the Commissioner disallowed the taxpayer's objection for the reason:
 
 'It is considered that the income received from Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd and Transfield Pty Ltd forms part of your assessable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">' 
 
 

Not surprisingly, the objection decision made no reference to the imposition of additional tax because it was not raised as a ground of objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Indeed, it was not mentioned in the objection at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">9 By letter dated 31 October 2003 solicitors acting for the taxpayer filed a statement of facts, issues and contentions on behalf of the taxpayer, however, the matter of additional tax was not raised as an issue and it certainly formed no part of the taxpayer's contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Not surprisingly, the Commissioner's amended statement of facts, issues and contentions dated 26 October 2004, likewise made no reference to the matter of additional tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">10 The first time the matter of additional tax or 'penalty', as it is sometimes referred to, was raised was before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">How it was raised and why the Tribunal allowed it to be raised is not disclosed in the transcript of proceedings before the Tribunal, nor in the Tribunal's reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">However, these documents suggest, with respect, that:
 
 (i) Neither counsel for the taxpayer, nor counsel for the Commissioner, nor the Tribunal was aware that the taxpayer had not included any ground in his notice of objection going to the additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">So much is exemplified in the following extract from p-95 of the transcript of the hearing on the second day (19 November 2004):
 'MR QUINN [Counsel for the Commissioner] : Just briefly on penalty, we say it is a matter --- the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">We say there wasn't full and true disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I mean, it couldn't be the case that having regard to the number of taxpayers and the way the Commissioner must administer the Act that not to put at least copies of the agreements, that that was full disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">To that extent we say that the amount of penalty is appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Unless there's anything else ---' 
 
 
 (ii) If counsel for the taxpayer was aware that the taxpayer had not included any ground in his notice of objection going to the additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, no attempt was made, by way of application to the Tribunal, to include the additional tax issue as an additional ground of objection and, even if an application was made, no such order was made by the Tribunal pursuant to s 14ZZK of the Administration Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">On the hearing of the appeal there was an interruptive protestation on the part of counsel for the taxpayer that any such conclusion would be misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However, it was not taken further (apart from what was said to be anecdotal evidence from the bar table) in the written submissions I afforded counsel for the taxpayer, at his request, further time to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">


 
 (iii) The Tribunal seems to have regarded itself as having jurisdiction with respect to not only additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, but also additional tax by way of interest for late payment of tax assessed pursuant to s 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the ITAA 36').</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">So much is exemplified in the following extract from p-77 of the transcript of the hearing on the second day:
 
 'MR RAPHAEL: Now, if we might go to the question of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 MR LINDSAY: And on that the witness gave evidence, did he --- the applicant gave evidence that the sum assessed has not yet been paid?</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 
 MR RAPHAEL: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 
 MR LINDSAY: So there must be quite a large amount of interest that has accrued on this sum, is that --- 
 
 MR RAPHAEL: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 
 MR LINDSAY: I'm not privy to all of the --- I haven't read all of the detail, Mr Raphael --- 
 
 MR RAPHAEL: One should not give evidence from the bar table but --- 
 
 MR LINDSAY: No, I know, but you are trying to --- I'm getting some assistance from you, but is interest running from 1987 on this amount?</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 
 MR RAPHAEL: So I would tender the report of the Australian Tax Office ...' 
 
 It is also exemplified in the Tribunal's reasons for decision:
 
 
 
 '57.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Where a taxpayer omits an item of assessable income from their return, s.223(7) deems the taxpayer to have made a statement in their return to the effect that they did not derive that item of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The provision applies in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 
 
 
 
 
 58.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">... 
 
 
 
 
 
 59.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I find that there are mitigating circumstances present in this matter that should be taken into account on review in the exercise of the discretion in s.227(3) to remit additional tax: 
 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">... 
 
 
 
 
 
 61.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">I accept the applicant's submission that this transaction or dealing is one that falls into the clearly arguable category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I also accept that his income tax return gave the respondent some information about the transaction and this should be contrasted with the situation where there is a total omission of any reference to the particular transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Having regard to the policy of encouraging accuracy and completeness of returns that is embodied in s.223, but being cognisant also that the discretion has been introduced to mitigate potential harshness resulting from the imposition of penalty under s.223(1) being double the amount of tax avoided, I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case in which to remit the culpability component of the penalty in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In relation to the per annum component, it is relevant to note that the respondent consented to the matter being held in abeyance for a number of years pending the finalisation of proceedings brought by Jones, extending to his appeals to the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I consider it appropriate that any per annum component be remitted for the entire period from the date of issue of the amended assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">' 
 
 
 

11 While the Tribunal's ultimate decision ([2], supra) in relation to 'penalty' is clearly a reference to additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, it is equally clear, in my view, that what the Tribunal is referring to in the last two sentences of par 61 of its reasons for decision and in the extract from the transcript cited above is the additional tax by way of interest pursuant to s 207 of the ITAA 36 and, if it is, it is clearly beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This latter matter was not, however, the subject of the Tribunal's ultimate decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It follows that ground 4.5 of the Amended Notice of Appeal is misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">12 I hesitate to suggest this, but it seems to me that the Tribunal's analysis of the 'penalty' issue was a function of the confused thinking inherent in the submissions put to the Tribunal by both counsel below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">This is further exemplified in the Commissioner's grounds of appeal and in his original written submissions, both having as their focus the construction and application of s 14ZS and, by force of the definitions therein, s 14ZQ of the Administration Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">13 It is s 14ZS, as originally enacted (see Taxation Laws Amendment (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">3) Act 1991 (Cth)), that applies to objection decisions that relate to the remission of additional tax under s 223 of the ITAA 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">As originally enacted, s 14ZS relevantly provided:
 
 
 '(1) For the purposes of this Part, an objection decision is an ineligible income tax remission decision if subsection (2) ... applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) An objection decision is an ineligible income tax remission decision if it relates to the remission of additional tax payable by a taxpayer under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 other than Division 11 of Part IIIAA , except where the additional tax is payable under Part VII of that Act and its amount, after the decision is made, exceeds: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) in the case of additional tax payable under section 223 of that Act because of the making of a statement: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) if the statement relates to only one year of income --- the amount calculated, in respect of the period commencing on the day that is the prescribed day in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income and ending on the day on which the assessment of the additional tax is made, at the rate of 20% per year of the amount of the relevant affected tax in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) ...' (Emphasis added) 
 
 
 
 

14 Relevantly, s 14ZQ defined 'objection decision' as having the meaning given by subs 14ZY(2), namely, by reference to subs 14ZY(1), a decision of the Commissioner to allow an objection, wholly or in part, or to disallow it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">15 It is difficult to understand the focus of the Commissioner on s 14ZS of the Administration Act in the present case when neither the taxpayer's objection nor, in consequence, the Commissioner's objection decision, referred in any way to the remission of additional tax imposed by the amended notice of assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In support of that focus I was referred to cases which, correctly in my view, hold that the words 'relates to' are wide words signifying some connection between two subject matters --- with the connection or association signified by the words being either direct or indirect, substantial or real.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">However, in the present case, there is absolutely no connection or association between the objection decision and the remission of additional tax payable under s 223 of the ITAA 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It may be, as the Full court of this Court observed in Grollo Nominees Pty Ltd v FC of T (1997) 73 FCR 452 at 523, 
 
 'that it would seem an odd thing if there were ... an appeal to the Tribunal on the question of the amount of income tax payable which did not carry with it the right to question any consequential imposition of additional tax', 
 
 

but this is such a case, in the absence of the Tribunal making an order pursuant to s 14ZZK of the Administration Act allowing the taxpayer to include the additional tax issue as an additional ground of objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In short, the objection decision in the present case is not an ineligible income tax remission decision under s 14ZS of the Administration Act and, insofar as the Commissioner's appeal is grounded on this issue, it must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">16 In his written submissions in reply, the Commissioner refocussed his argument, to where it always should have been focussed, on subs 43(1) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">17 Subsection 43(1) of the AAT Act is in the following terms:
 
 'For the purpose of reviewing a decision, the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred by any relevant enactment on the person who made the decision and shall make a decision in writing: 
 
 
 
 (a) affirming the decision under review; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) varying the decision under review; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) setting aside the decision under review and: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) making a decision in substitution for the decision so set aside; or 
 
 (ii) remitting the matter for reconsideration in accordance with any directions or recommendations of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">' 
 
 
 
 

18 The Commissioner submitted that the present appeal was one where the remission of penalty by the Tribunal could not have been for the purpose of reviewing the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It was not relevant to the making of the decision because the parameters of that decision had already been set by the taxpayer's objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It could not have been properly raised by the taxpayer before the Tribunal unless and until an order was obtained by the taxpayer under s 14ZZK(a) of the Administration Act which did not occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">As such, there could not be 'an association' between the power exercised by the Tribunal and the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">If an objection had been made to the assessment of penalty and an objection decision had been made in relation to that matter, there may have been (subject to the operation of s 14ZS of the Administration Act) some basis for saying that the exercise of a power to remit by the Tribunal was in the words of Hill J in Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson (1992) 37 FCR 32 'relevant to the making of the decision under review'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">There would be present 'an association' between any exercise of discretion by the Tribunal to remit penalty and the objection decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">19 In my view, this misconceives the matter and puts an impermissible gloss upon s 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">20 While the taxpayer did not include in his objection a ground putting in issue the imposition of additional tax; and while the Commissioner's objection decision disallowing the taxpayer's objection did not, in consequence, deal with that issue; and while the taxpayer had no right to agitate the issue before the Tribunal unless the Tribunal otherwise ordered (s 14ZZK(a) of the Administration Act), which the Tribunal did not, nevertheless, in deciding the taxpayer's objection, the Commissioner could have further remitted the additional tax imposed at label D of the notice of amended assessment, pursuant to the discretion vested in him by subs 227(3) of the ITAA 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The fact that he had already exercised this discretion, at the time of assessment to remit the additional tax to $586,858.75 was no bar or impediment to his further remission of the additional tax at the time of making his objection decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">21 If this be right, then it is difficult to see why subs 43(1) of the AAT Act did not give the Tribunal jurisdiction to make that part of the decision against which this appeal is brought, namely, remission of the penalty matter to the Commissioner with the direction that the assessment for the year ended 30 June 1988 be amended by remitting additional tax in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Subsection 43(1) of the AAT Act has been construed as not requiring the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal as being necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review: Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson supra at 39 --- 40.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 244 (30 November 2005, unreported) the Full Court of this Court observed at [29] --- [30]:
 
 '...Section 43 empowers the Tribunal to exercise all the powers and discretions conferred upon the original decision-maker, provided it does so for the purpose of reviewing a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Provided the necessary purpose is present, the power conferred upon the Tribunal is not otherwise limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">It is neither necessary nor permissible to put a gloss upon s 43 that would permit the Tribunal to exercise the discretion maker's powers and discretions only when those powers or discretions are necessarily interdependent with the decision under review, or where the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal is necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review --- see Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson [supra].</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 Thus, so long as the exercise of powers and discretions by the Tribunal is for the purpose of reviewing a decision, all of the powers and discretions conferred by any relevant enactment on the decision-maker who made the decision, can be exercised by the Tribunal' (Emphasis)
 

22 In making this observation, the Full Court was adopting the views expressed by Hill J in Hodgson .</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In particular, what his Honour went on to say in that case at 40:
 
 'Of course there must be an association between the power to be exercised by the Tribunal and the decision under review, but that association is to be found in the restriction of the grant of power in s 43(1) to the purpose of the Tribunal's review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The test is one of relevance rather than dependence .</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Where the exercise of a power or discretion is relevant to the making of the decision under review then, if requested, the Tribunal may exercise the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">' (Emphasis)
 

23 There can be no doubt, in the present case, that the exercise by the Tribunal of the discretion to remit the matter of the additional tax to the Commissioner with a direction that the additional tax be remitted in full is relevant to the making of the objection decision, if not dependent upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In that sense, the Tribunal exercised the discretion for the purpose of reviewing the objection decision and any argument that it did not must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">24 For the foregoing reasons, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 
 I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Edmonds.</sentence>
